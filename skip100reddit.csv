We all know the economy is bad, the future looks bleak with AI and Blackrock. I just dont know how this ends or transitions into something else? Are us Westerners gonna have to move to Somalia just to be able to afford life? Is there going to be a French Revolution 2.0? Is there going to be a civil war? All I know is, this cant continue the way its been going. And it wont. Change is the only constant. My prediction is, America votes for more government control after the Boomers die. This means we will have universal health care, free college, and some sort of housing cost control. Its going to be hell for the next 20-30 years. There may be short term prosperity for 10-15 years, then it will be hell again when the US dollar is worth nothing after they run out of money for their programs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lxhh27/so_whata_gonna_happen_when_nobody_can_afford_to/,1277

Instead it gives you a free service but sells your information to companies which in turn make ads that is designed for you. This results in some ethical debates as well you use these websites and give it information that you wouldnt tell your closes friends. On top of that it is impossible for there to be competition as if you had a choice between two companies that are free you would pick what is something that you have always used. On the other hand having monthly payments would be annying in a pay by month service world.

GenZ,2025-07-11 03:17:41,Hot Take: I actually liked the pandemic,"Everyday, I see people here and beyond talking about how detrimental the pandemic was to society, particularly Gen Z, but the truth is, I personally really liked the pandemic. Now obviously I did not like the deaths that COVID brought. Instead, I will be discussing the lockdown it brought. This is all my personal experience, although Im sure theres some that will relate. Essentially, my life wasnt that different from the one the pandemic brought upon the rest of the world. All my life, I had been bullied at school. I hated going outside, and while I did enjoy school, I would have preferred doing it online. When the lockdown came, it was heaven for me. The whole world got to see and experience the world through my lenses. It was nice knowing people knew what it was like to be home all day, to cut constant interaction with others. Not having to go outside. Staying home all day long, being safe. And I made more friends online than I would ever have made in person. The pandemic basically helped me, gave me some peace of mind. People always complain that the pandemic ruined their social lives, but COVID did the opposite to me. To this day, all my friends are online friends, simply because no one ever wanted to hang out with me physically. And Im okay with that, having unconventional friends is better than having none. Lastly, the pandemic was just a very fun time for me. Having so much time meant more time to explore new things, which for me included making YouTube videos. And while I dont do that anymore, I never would have even considered that had it not been for the spare time the pandemic brought. And quite frankly, if another pandemic happened, I would feel the same way. I know many people will disagree, but I do honestly think people only talk about how bad the pandemic was and forget about any good things that may have occurred during the time. Tl;dr: The pandemic was an introverts dream. No social interaction for a time was really refreshing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lwwdme/hot_take_i_actually_liked_the_pandemic/,77

I asume that because of her job that she takes hours to answer my messages and that is not a problem for me. Yesterday I made her food so she didn't buy at Uber Eats because she doesn't bring lunch, she liked my food she said that I also gave her some chocolate kisses.

GenZ,2025-07-10 22:27:45,Am I ready for parenthood or am I unfulfilled?,"As a nearly 30 yo female I'm very aware that my body is telling me to procreate for biological reasons. I don't feel so much societal pressure to have a kid as I expected to, which is a great thing for our generation, but I'm really confused about whether I want a baby for the right reasons. I've always been incredibly maternal, and couldn't wait to be pregnant/become a mother growing up. I have a natural affinity for children and have felt very at peace dealing with babies and young kids since I was barely a teen myself. For many years I've been convinced I wouldn't have them, mostly due to state of the climate, national economy, maternity packages in the countries I'd have an opportunity to raise them in, and personal/family history of both myself and my partners' mental health. I've suffered with depression in the past and have come along way but still feel this undeniable base level of sadness/unfulfillment. I've worked hard and gained a fair few qualifications, done lots of voluntary work, and have a great support system of family and friends, i.e. I've taken the obvious steps alongside having rewarding hobbies and years of therapy to feel ""whole"" and enjoy life, and this feeling had been part of reason I didn't want to have kids, but I'm wondering now whether it's exactly the reason I should. I'm quite confident that having a child would give me a purpose in life and help to light up my world, but this always seemed like a really selfish and arguably inappropriate reason to do it. However, I'm now wondering whether it's entirely natural that I would feel this way as our innate urge to procreate does still exist in most of us, and perhaps there's nothing wrong with requiring this element in life to feel fulfilled.

Shortly after that I did tire technician work for 3 months but quit bc on top of roadside we were also expected to do the maintenance teams job and clean truckers sh*t (not metaphorically either). I tried a sales job at my mother's recommendation despite me suggesting I wouldn't work well in that field (bad social anxiety) and surprise it wasn't a good fit. Took a month or two but then I found a factory job. I was desperate so I said yes but I didn't realize I'd be so tired I'd come home shower and then sleep till my next shift regularly. I tried it but it just got to be too much. Ive gone back to looking but there's just nothing around. Im in a small area so it doesn't help but all I see is sales and the worst most physically demanding jobs u can think of. Im applying to some of the better looking break ur back core type jobs but is it this bad everywhere? Is it just bad luck or is this all there? How do u find a job that is worth staying or atleast decent enough u stay bc its better then the rest?,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lw7jej/is_it_normal_to_struggle_finding_a_long_term_job/,0

It made me think about how the game felt when I first started playing. Also a conversation about the MegaMan BattleNetwork series at work sparked up, which got me in the nostalgic mood. It's insane that a few of you weren't alive when I was playing the 1.4 beta in 2011. The game had a large following even before release. Redstone was fairly new, and I think piston's were just released. I remember staying up trying to figure out how to make double doors open with pressure plates at the *same* time. I don't enjoy that the caves now seem overly ubuiqitous, like a chore to venture, rather than a treat to find. I remember the old trick, where you had to press f11 (I think) and one of the graphs would spike in the direction of the cave. The content surrounding Minecraft was also semi-pleasant. [Like when Carl from The Walking Dead played Minecraft](https://youtu.be/WzZXbtr1dMs?si=hCMnrM47nnJn0Y1p). Back when you had to get frapps (or find a cracked version) before OBS became known or was available. I'm happy the community exists still, and new things are being added to it to this day. It even more pleases me that legacy versions ([like 1.4 beta](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_Beta_1.4)) are available for easy download. Anyways, just feeling nostalgic, wondering if anyone else has such a pleasant memory like mine. Frapps wasn't pleasant though. OBS is a f*cking God send.

Im a Zoomer guy who is trying to stay hopeful, but sometimes I genuinely wonder how others manage to stay motivated and think positively about the future and do things like starting a family (esp. having kids, taking mortgages, etc...) when we seem to be inheriting a world that feels increasingly hostile to us, especially to the ones who aren't rich or isolated. From overwhelming wealth inequality that makes it seem like working won't really get you anything anymore, and the mental health crisis to the cost of living disaster, climate change, wars essentially on every continent, automation threatening any chance for us to be able to climb the career ladder without being ""someone's child"", and less-talked-about issues like the healthcare worker shortage (aka that many of us wouldn't even be able to get an affordable, quality doctor to treat us), ecosystem collapse, rising crime and addiction rates, and even the looming threat of antibiotics-resistant bacteria its a lot.

On Monday we were planning on going to another Ice Cream place(I was actually planning on telling her how I fell that day) but at lunch she informed me she was feeling really tired and I told her I understood and I asked if we could reschedule to Wednesday, which she gave a ""If I'm feeling up to it then yes"" however today she just cancelled again over text, apologizing and asking if we can reschedule. Normally I would definitely just decide she doesn't want to hangout with me and move on however there are some factors that stop me. 1. I'm almost positive she's not lying about being tired, we work nightshift at a decently physically demanding job and she's works a fuck ton of overtime (the past 2 weeks she's worked 55+ hours each week) and I know how much nightshift can drain you even if you have normal hours. She mentioned how one day after getting home she slept almost 13 hours. 2. We have genuinely been having fun together I think, we're having good conversations and learning about each other. She also informed me (in a non-trauma dumpy way) of her traumatizing past and we talked about that and how she's recovered 3. She mentioned cancelling on another friend of hers because she was tired.

Growing up I felt as if there were more niche things, people in their own circles whether they were punks, jocks, nerds or whatever. However all these groups actually had something in common which was that they found superficial and materialistic things quite lame. I remember girls and female celebrities being tired of reality tv stars, and there was growing concern about what social media would do (which... wow the old people finally got one right!). Sure some of that hate could be jealousy, but I don't think it was the foundation for criticizing desperate fame. But that desperate fame seems more charming to people now. Like if that's what they have to do to get that bag, go for it. Most art depicted the folly of greed as well. Apart from political condemnation of billionaires, praise of wealth and materialism seem higher than ever. And in fact criticism of that very much makes you the party pooper. It feels like the rich kids at school won, everyone wants to be Regina George not Cady. Most things are treated the way women use Halloween costumes, IT HAS TO BE SEXY. If something is goth it has to be sexy goth. Sexy nerd. Sexy poet. Sexy entrepreneur. Sexy painting. Sexy dancing. Sexy sex. I can't really think of who could be the Bill Hicks or George Carlin for gen z, the types who took a sledgehammer to the commercial culture of America. Maybe Bo Burnham, but he was quite ineffective and tame. I don't think we have to be mean to current icons but I do think we need some counterweight here. I also used to think Americans were uniquely superficial, until I got into kpop and learned a little more about the current culture for young people there lol. Mexico is changing closer to us too, to my surprise Japan also seems more superficial given that these types of conversations don't tend to happen at all there.

GenZ,2025-07-09 03:17:38,Advice Needed!,"I am 25F and I currently work at an afterschool program as a Assistant General Manager but I just got offered an interview at a medical office as a Front Desk Assistant with a typical 9-5 schedule and benefits but the pay is the same (which is fine because I have a roommate and can cover most of my necessities with my current pay). Everything is going well but then my boss at my current job just got hired somewhere else and her last day in the 25th. I am lowkey nervous because what if the owner of my current job wants to promote me? I would be salaried but there wouldn't be a big change to my work schedule (hour wise) and I would have to work as both GM and AGM since they won't find a replacement right away and this job is easy to be stuck in for a long time (it took my manager 5 years just to have weekends off and now she is leaving after 7 years). Since it's basically family owned, we current do not have benefits for both full time and part time employees.

GenZ,2025-07-09 03:17:34,The reason why immigrants are being frowned upon,"When you have people flooding into a country with no initiative to assimilate to the values and culture that country was built upon , the cultural climate of that country starts to change. White people arent the only ones worried about this but A lot of African Americans are coming to understand how this is impacting us as well. A lot immigrants come to place where ethnic enclaves are formed so they operate, live and work entirely inside their communities with no incentive to assimilate. Thats why you have Hispanics , Asians etc that have been here 20+ years and still dont know English. The biggest thing upsetting foundational American (those here before mass immigration) Whites (predominantly of English descent) black/African Americans (started being forced here as slaves in the 1600s) and natives (original people of this land). You go to some places like south Florida, Texas , California or New York and are being to made to feel like you dont belong in somewhere where you have historically always been. Many of the groups didnt not start having a actual presence until the 80s or 90s . These groups exhibit clannish behavior. For ex) once they are hired at a company they will hire nothing but Indians or Hispanic, they form communities that have entirely nothing but Asians or Hispanics. They will get in government and start putting policies in place that pushes you out of your community. For ex) Hispanics and California and south Florida requiring that employees speak Spanish. Wonder why the holidays arent the same as they were back in the day. Thats because country values shifts when it so many different ethnic groups here that do not share the same values. I could go on and on and on and on about how illegal immigration and multiculturalism has impacted American but if I did this post would be a whole book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lv8ffi/the_reason_why_immigrants_are_being_frowned_upon/,0

They have the tools in place to get back on track if they ever find a break and are able. They dont understand how its like to be on the other end. They dont understand how fucking debilitating it is hearing them shit talk you everytime they see you eating vegetables, healthier meats, being mindful of fat and sugar. Tracking calories. Its debilitating, not once has anyone in my family ever said they were happy I began exercising or began eating healthy. After years of shit talking me behind my back for eating French fries and burgers and chicken nuggets all the time. I still enjoy these things but Im more mindful of them, in fact I cook them by myself sometimes, as a cheaper and healthier alternative. They dont know how horrible and evil it is to catch yourself binge eating, and have everyone you know not only unconcerned, but *encouraging* you and giving you more sweets and cookies and cakes. Youre not in your right mind, its like taking advantage of a drunk woman. You know how fucked it is, cant even have a single meal in peace without my father or mother or brother walking in going Youre a grown ass man, stop thinking about what you eat like gee, thanks, I dont want to look like any of you. How depressing it is, to have not once heard Im so glad my son is eating healthy/exercising or Im so glad my son has found a way to do it despite his responsibilities its some bullshit or its them using *my* responsibilities as an excuse to tell me to fucking give up. Or when they can, using whatever means they have over me to make it impossible for me to reach my goals for the day.

Im five foot eight and all I used to do was play Sonic the hedgehog. Of course youre bigger, in face, youre still getting bigger, not in a good way To hear your fatass +300lbs Buffon of a father talk you down because fiber is bad for you apparently, because it Catches food then spits it out, telling you bodybuilders like the rock eat 7000 calories a day to Recover from a measly 2 mile walk. And how I need to eat 5000 everyday if I were sitting on my fucking ass all day not working out. And I ought do 10k because I am. All of this while youre consistently gaining muscle/weight on a lean bulk of 2.7k-3k calories BECAUSE you walk 20k steps a day and lift 3 times a week. They dont believe it How fucking insane it is to have been overweight (175lbs, 20M, 5'8) and *still* considered tiny and skinny compared to the rest of them. Being told Im Sickly and Anorexic at 160, because I knew theyd lose their shit if I told them I was 150lbs. I went from 138 to 147 now after a slow lean bulk over 6 months (Albiet a couple of binging days) and they still dont see it. Im still the eternally anorexic girl-man to them. But Im feeling the effects of extra weight, weirdness and discomfort. In addition to some muscle gain. I dont understand how you can live being over 200lbs. how I ever lived at my previous weight You have no idea how blessed you are to have someone there to kick you in the ass when youre eating like shit. When youre inconsistent with exercise. It hurts your feelings, sure, but they love you. Thats why they tell you these things. Doesnt mean theyre *correct*, doesnt mean that *Their* way of being healthy is what you should do. But its proof they love you. Ive been sabotaged, limited, socially isolated and manipulated by my parents for so long and Im only now noticing it. My older sis has been trying to tell us for years but wed never listen. Id never listen. I can trust theyll want me to move out, but looking back at all the opportunities I missed because of fire bullshit they may provide for me, but they dont seem to want me to provide for myself.

Ive been doing everything I imagine a competent young person should be doing at this point in my life. I got my education, went back for an MBA etc. I have a relatively low pay, entry level accounting job which for now lets me pursue my hobbies (BJJ,MMA, Lifting) so Im comfortable. More than comfortable actually. On paper, Id consider my life set up to be firmly above average. Im fit, food/shelter secure, eat out relatively often, have childhood friends I speak to semi regularly that still live close by, etc. Maybe I could travel more but thats not really my thing. The point is,Im not really that happy in all honesty. I feel kind of isolated a lot of the time, and I feel like at almost 24 years old, I shouldve developed more socially. My experiences with girls havent been that great, and they dont seem to like me too much. I was recently at a friends 4th of July party, and I think there was a girl that initially had some attraction to me, but my awkward demeanor and lack of social skills kind of killed it. Hinge and the dating apps dont seem to bear any fruit for me, and it just generally seems like I have no avenues through which to accomplish something I thought was a basic part of the human experience: a relationship. That plus the realization that my generation will likely not experience the quality of life our grandparents had due to the state of the world (ai/automation, global politics, etc) has just put me in a weird mood. Like what else do I do? I feel like Ive been checking a lot of the boxes of adulting for several years now, and Im content with my results internally, but externally it seems like it hasnt made much difference. I think maybe a lot of Gen Z guys can relate to this but I havent really discussed this with anyone irl. Just wanted to vent.

My style is basically what many English speakers call bland music, but honestly, that blandness is exactly what I love. For example, I have started liking Alex Warrens songs. I know a lot of people say his music is bland, but to me, that simplicity makes it so nice and calming. I just love simple songs with simple lyrics. I do not really like overdone songs with too much heavy mixing like rap, but I do listen to Coldplay sometimes, and I also watch videos of Freddie Mercury and Nirvana, though I only occasionally listen to their music. It is not that I hate them, they are legends, but when I just want to listen to music peacefully or feel emotional, those are not my first choices. I usually go with songs that are calm and straightforward, including songs in my mother tongue that suit this mood. But now I feel like I already know most of the common songs in this style, so I want to seek your opinions and find some underrated songs that are simple, melodic, and nice. I do not like songs with too much instrumental where the voice gets hidden. I love songs where the bare voice stands out with simple instrumentals. Also, as a side note, I really love songs that start slow and melodic and then go high and powerful in the chorus, like What Makes You Beautiful by One Direction, Carry You Home by Alex Warren, Best Song Ever by One Direction, Stitches by Shawn Mendes, and most Coldplay songs with that type of build up.

Lets talk about social media's damages: dopamine is one of the most important brain chemistry. It helps our to feel joyful because it triggers the happines. And people who producted short video content almost know this information more than too many psychologist. Thats why we struggle to give up from them.

I study film history, the movie industry as a whole, etc. Most people just watch movies for fun and dont really care about film as an art. I love classic movies, especially films from the 1940s to the 1960s. My favorite comedy is *Some Like It Hot*. I recently saw *Jurassic World: Rebirth*, and I didn't like it at all. My theater was full of Gen Z kids, millennials, and parents with little kids. And after the movie ended, they all clapped. This movie was awful. Sure, the CGI was good, three action scenes were solid, and the cinematography was amazingbut outside of that, it was bad. The characters were dull and one-note. You dont care about any of them. You might only like Zora and Duncan, but thats just because they're played by Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali. The plot? A CEO hires a team of mercenaries and a paleontologist to go to an island and collect samples from dinosaurs to cure diseases. Simple video game logicfine, whatever. But then they randomly introduce this annoying family who has no reason to be in the movie. The daughters boyfriends are all insufferable, and whats worse is if the characters didnt literally tell you one guy was her boyfriend, you wouldnt even know. They barely talk. They dont kiss. They dont have any one-on-one scenes. Hes just there. And people *actually* like this movie? Forget compelling, rich characters. Forget strong plotting. Casual audiences just want to be distracted. Thats what gets to me. Because I saw *The Brutalist* last year, and I was the only one in the auditorium. No one came to see this well-crafted film with stunning visuals, cinematography, and *great* acting. But everyone packed out the theater for the new *Jurassic World* moviea film doing nothing new, a franchise that shouldve ended after *Jurassic Park III*. So I want to askpeople who are my age or a little older, like 21 to 25do you *actually* like this corporate slop?

GenZ,2025-07-05 07:39:25,"My parents have a negative opinion of me, they think I'm a stupid loser","It's clear to me that my parents have a negative opinion of me ever since highschool. I remember one time I went to hangout with some friends and my father said ""use this to practice your social skills""??? As if I never hung out with people before and am a loser. Another time when he introduced me to his friends from work, earlier that day i had a meeting with a counselor for school and my parents attended. My father then said when talking to his friends from work to have a conversation like I just did in school, he literally thinks I have no other conversational experience. Now that I am in college and live by myself for a large part of the year they literally expect me to be on my phone 24/7 or something. When my mother calls or texts me and I'm unavailable at that moment she always says shit that I honestly find to be mean spirited. She says why aren't you responding u just spend all day in your room and on your phone doing nothing all day. She never assumes that I'm outside hanging out with friends even tho that's sometimes the case or anything like that because they think I'm a loser. She also seems to have no faith in me when I want to do something. When I say i go to the gym regularly now she says I'm lying. When I say i want to try and start cooking for myself she sarcastically says sure you will. My father also says I spend all day playing video games which isn't even true, even when I live with them, I was never as big as a gamer as my brother which I think is why they say this about me. There's also the thinking I'm stupid part which I think people from the outside will understand. I've failed classes and because they pay for my college I understand why they are mad at me. However, they have never had faith in me since the start. I do a stem degree and ever since I applied they wanted me to change because they think I'm stupid. Even when it started they asked me every time we called without fail do you want to change you should change its too hard for you. Before I ever failed a class.

I was having a (drunk) discussion with my friends tonight about a girl I was talking to that Im pretty sure was just talking to me in a friendly manner, and then that turned into a convo about whether guys and girls can be friends, and then I was wondering if our generation believes in friends before dating. And see, my problem is that I need to be able to have a somewhat established connection with someone to actually want to date them. Like there are a couple of friends I have/had, that are attractive, but I dont feel compatible with and so I wouldnt date. I even realized last year with one girl, that after liking her when she wasnt available, it was only because I thought she was attractive and because I was just getting desperate. In actuality, we were better off as friends even if she would have liked me back. So I want to make sure I dont fall for a girl Im infatuated with. However, I always hear that a bad thing guys do is hide his intentions or like a friend. And I know everyone is different and situations vary, but its still confusing. I feel like Im lost on how to approach things. Like am I wrong to want to have a deeper understanding of someone before committing to them?

# Rate Limit UI & Analysis Transparency

## Overview
Provides transparent UI indicators for rate limit status and analysis progress, especially when batch analysis fails or rate limits are hit during fallback mode.

## What It Does

### 1. Analysis Status Banner
Displays a prominent banner showing:
- **Analysis method**: Batch or Individual (fallback)
- **Completion status**: Success, Warning, or Error
- **Items analyzed**: "Analyzed X of Y items"
- **Rate limit information**: When limits are hit

### 2. Visual Indicators
- **Green (Success)**: Batch analysis completed successfully
- **Yellow (Warning)**: Fallback mode or partial results
- **Red (Error)**: Rate limit reached during analysis

### 3. Transparent Information
Users can see:
- Which analysis method was used
- How many items were analyzed
- Why analysis stopped (if applicable)
- Rate limit status

---

## How It Works

### Backend (app.py)

#### Status Tracking
```python
# Track analysis status
analysis_method = 'batch'  # or 'fallback'
rate_limit_hit = False
total_items = len(comments) + 1  # +1 for post
items_analyzed = 0
```

#### Response Structure
```json
{
  "analysis_status": {
    "method": "batch" | "fallback",
    "items_analyzed": 6,
    "items_total": 6,
    "rate_limit_hit": false,
    "partial_results": false,
    "message": "Batch analysis completed successfully (1 API call)"
  }
}
```

### Frontend (index.html + script.js)

#### Display Function
```javascript
displayAnalysisStatus(analysisStatus)
```

Automatically called when URL analysis results are shown.

#### Banner Types
1. **Success** (Green)
   - Batch analysis completed
   - All items analyzed

2. **Warning** (Yellow)
   - Fallback mode used
   - Partial results (some items not analyzed)

3. **Error** (Red)
   - Rate limit hit
   - Analysis stopped early

## User Experience

### Scenario 1: Batch Success
```
✅ Analysis Complete
Batch analysis completed successfully (1 API call)
[BATCH ANALYSIS badge]
```

### Scenario 2: Fallback Mode
```
⚠️ Analysis Complete (Fallback Mode)
Analysis completed using individual API calls (6 calls)
[INDIVIDUAL ANALYSIS badge]
```

### Scenario 3: Rate Limit Hit
```
❌ Rate Limit Reached
Rate limit reached. Analyzed 4 of 6 items
[INDIVIDUAL ANALYSIS badge]

[Cooldown timer appears below]
⏱️ Gemini API cooldown: 2m 45s remaining
Sign in to remove cooldowns
```

### Scenario 4: Partial Results
```
⚠️ Partial Analysis Complete
Partial analysis completed. Analyzed 3 of 6 items
[INDIVIDUAL ANALYSIS badge]
```

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`app.py`**
   - Added `analysis_method`, `rate_limit_hit`, `items_analyzed` tracking
   - Added `analysis_status` field to response
   - Tracks status in both batch and fallback paths

2. **`templates/index.html`**
   - Added `#analysisStatusBanner` div
   - Added CSS styles for status banner
   - Added `displayAnalysisStatus()` JavaScript function

3. **`static/js/script.js`**
   - Updated `showURLResults()` to call `displayAnalysisStatus()`

### CSS Classes

- `.analysis-status-banner` - Main container
- `.analysis-status-banner.success` - Green success state
- `.analysis-status-banner.warning` - Yellow warning state
- `.analysis-status-banner.error` - Red error state
- `.badge.batch` - Batch analysis badge
- `.badge.fallback` - Individual analysis badge

### Dark Mode Support
All colors have dark mode variants using CSS custom properties.

## How to Use

### For Users
1. Analyze a URL with Gemini model
2. Look for the status banner above results
3. Check the badge to see analysis method
4. Read the message for details

### For Developers

#### Add Status to New Endpoints
```python
response['analysis_status'] = {
    'method': 'batch',
    'items_analyzed': 10,
    'items_total': 10,
    'rate_limit_hit': False,
    'partial_results': False,
    'message': 'Custom status message'
}
```

#### Display Status in Frontend
```javascript
if (data.analysis_status) {
    displayAnalysisStatus(data.analysis_status);
}
```

## Benefits

### 1. Transparency
Users understand exactly what happened during analysis:
- Which method was used
- How many items were analyzed
- Why analysis stopped (if applicable)

### 2. Education
Users learn about:
- Batch vs individual analysis
- Rate limits and cooldowns
- Benefits of signing in

### 3. Trust
Clear communication builds trust:
- No hidden failures
- Honest about limitations
- Explains partial results

### 4. Actionable
Users know what to do:
- Sign in for higher limits
- Wait for cooldown
- Try different model

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Batch Success
1. Analyze short Reddit post (< 5 comments)
2. **Expected**: Green banner, "Batch analysis completed"

### Test Case 2: Fallback Mode
1. Analyze long Reddit post (triggers JSON error)
2. **Expected**: Yellow banner, "Fallback mode", shows API call count

### Test Case 3: Rate Limit Hit
1. Make 2 Gemini requests (anonymous)
2. On 3rd request, analyze URL with 5 comments
3. **Expected**: Red banner, "Rate limit reached", shows partial count

### Test Case 4: Partial Results
1. Analyze URL with 10 comments
2. Rate limit hits at comment 3
3. **Expected**: Yellow banner, "Analyzed 4 of 11 items" (1 post + 3 comments)

---

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions
1. **Real-time Progress**: Show progress during analysis (requires WebSockets)
2. **Retry Button**: Allow users to retry failed items
3. **Export Partial Results**: Download what was analyzed
4. **Analytics**: Track fallback frequency and rate limit hits

### Not Implemented (By Design)
- Real-time updates during analysis (adds complexity)
- Automatic retry on failure (could waste API calls)
- Detailed per-item status (too much UI clutter)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Banner Not Showing
**Check:**
1. `analysis_status` field in API response
2. `displayAnalysisStatus` function loaded
3. `#analysisStatusBanner` element exists
4. JavaScript console for errors

### Wrong Banner Type
**Check:**
1. `rate_limit_hit` flag is set correctly
2. `partial_results` calculation is correct
3. `items_analyzed` vs `items_total` values

### Styling Issues
**Check:**
1. CSS loaded (inline in HTML)
2. Dark mode classes applied correctly
3. Browser cache cleared

## Summary

This feature makes the analysis process transparent by showing users:
- ✅ What analysis method was used
- ✅ How many items were analyzed
- ✅ Why analysis stopped (if applicable)
- ✅ What actions they can take

It improves user trust and understanding while providing clear, actionable information about rate limits and analysis status.

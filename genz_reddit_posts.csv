GenZ,2025-07-14 16:24:50,Just wanted to share!,"Hi! I am a 24F struggling with confidence and self-esteem. I have always been an introverted soul and always tried to do things from the back, never stepped forward, and never got a chance to do something that made everyone proud. But these days, I am trying to improve myself and build my confidence, but I feel like I am not getting it because I see people around me doing so well and being so confident when it comes to public speaking and networking. I was just wondering today I just want to feel that moment when it feels like being confident and people feel proud of you, that all eyes are on you, and people are watching you. I recently started showing interest in F1, and one thing I was curious about is: when these people win that race, what must they be feeling? What must they be thinking? How does it feel to win? I just really want to LIVE that moment when I win something, or I represent something, or give a presentation on a large scale. I know I am the only one who has to do the hard work and make this thing happen, but sometimes I question myself will I be able to do this one day or not?",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lzqyfk/just_wanted_to_share/,2

What's the point of fucking up if people are just going to get mad at you for doing so. Im saying this because I've had multiple experiences with friends and family where If I don't do something correct or perfectly the first time, I either got grounded, scolded, or just being a disappointment to others. So I grew up equating Mistakes = bad , bad = bad person. I feel like im a bad person for not being perfect. That's why being wrong pisses me off most of the time cause it means im a bad person again. This is why its damn near impossible for me to get into new hobbies, because all I can think about is the need to be PERFECT, because I know if im not perfect theres always gonna be someone who's disappointment in me or complain that I didn't do it right. It's also one of the reasons why I don't want friends or be in a relationship, cause all I can think about is perfectionism, and nobody wants to be in a relationship with someone who's constantly stressed about being Perfect.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lzojx1/nobody_is_perfect_until_you_dont_do_something/,2

GenZ,2025-07-14 11:18:53,Are GenZ defensive about the enshittification of cultural norms?,"Do you think that Gen Z get rather defensive about decline of cultural norms as they come of age? Millennials were openly nostalgic of better times when people dressed better, music was better, so on. Now Gen Z seems to have done a 180 where they defend objectively worse things while criticising past norms. I'm not talking about politics. I'm talking about almost innocuous things like sports, movies, music. For example, Gen Z idolise millennial actresses who objectively are worse actresses than those who were in the prime in the 90s and earlier. Emma Stone has obviously been a downgrade in terms of acting abilities and beauty from someone like Nicole Kidman. Yet some Gen Zs will try to claim that she's one of the best to ever do it. I don't think one Millennial would've said the same things about Scarlett Johansson or Natalie Portman. I don't think anyone tried to argue that Harry Potter was some cinematic masterpiece as opposed to entertainment. Well given the decline in the West's economic dominance, the twin decline in cultural standards is rather understandable, yet Gen Z don't seem to accept it?

Everyday when I open this app I've been seeing an increasing amount of heavily incel coded posts that have hundreds of thousands of likes, targeting random men and women as ""blackpill content"" and publicly humiliating them by calling them ugly among other things. Why are we as a generation allowing this sick ideology to spread? Why is TikTok allowing it especially? I'm sick of seeing incels force insecurities about their appearance and not getting into relationships because they're horrible, disgusting people. But they have somehow normalised blaming it on ""looksism"" and women. It's such a harmful way of thinking and it's actually poisoning this generation of men as social media platforms allow it to stay up and go viral. I know personally if I saw this stuff as a young teen I would have genuinely fallen into the incel rabbithole, thankfully, it was hardly as prevelant back then. Why can't we all just get along and stop blaming women for relationship issues and shaming ""unattractive people"" as being ""unsaveable"".

I am here on your defense: There is no such thing as a GenZ stare.,"When I saw the TikToks going viral on this issue I thought that this must be something particular to American young people, because I haven't seen this or experience this at all. I have met socially awkward people, especially on my job, but I didn't get the stare at all. Just normal every day awkwardness I would sometimes be guilty of doing myself. However, today, there was an incident at my village where a boy went missing. So I went outside to look for the kid. He was a toddler, autistic and non-verbal. So the mum was distressed and we were all worried. I got in touch with the mum on facebook, she told me where she lost him, decided to walk towards that direction and I happen to see a man with a little boy. Looked like the boy in the pics, he was crying, so I thought ""Oh he has been found and that man must be the father."" So decided to walk towards them, reached the dad while he put him down on the ground for a while, approached them and I was like ""Hi! Is this the little boy that went missing?"" And there it was. The stare. Took him like what felt a minute to reply ""Yes."" Then grabbed the kid and continued walking. No acknowledgement, nothing. It's so strange. And the thing is, it made me even more worried, because I only knew the mum and I had no idea who this man was and the fact he gave me no interaction rather than the buffer stare and a quick yes, I got nervous that someone might be kidnapping this kid, so I called the mum and told her that I saw the kid and asked if everything was ok. And she told me yes and thanked me for the help. So don't worry, it's not just you who are doing this.

(along with ADHD and ODD in elementary school) Which would later down the road not be a valid diagnosis once DSM-5 came out. And I ultimately wound up with f84.8 (ICD-10 code for: Other Pervasive Developmental Disorders) Most people would agree that autism isn't something you outgrow, But at the same time, you can't deny that there is a subtype of people seemingly associated with its PDD/ASD cohorts, who indeed did outgrow those baseline conditions, that were typically diagnosed with PDD-NOS in the first place. Hence, why in my opinion, they were never actually autistic to begin with. They instead were either misdiagnosed, or due to placeholders, overlapped with other conditions like ADD/ADHD, and simply had ""safety nets"" like PDD-NOS to help them in, say, a school setting.

My current situation: * I pretty much focused on studying and establishing my career after high school, attending several years of post-secondary education, all in effort to secure a relatively high-paying job with decent work-life balance. * Now, I live alone in an apartment I rent (of course keep in touch with my immediate family), have my own vehicle, and have over $250K CAD saved and invested. I pay all my bills on time, have no significant debt or student loans, etc. * I currently work in healthcare, making just over $100K CAD this year, working around 40 hours per week. Last year I made more, though at a stressful job in what was frankly a shithole place that I knew I had to get out of eventually, so I've moved to a more desirable city to prioritize better quality of life. * I work out at least 3-4 times a week, watch my diet and keep in good shape, since my health is definitely my top priority. I've gotten many unsolicited compliments from others in the past about my physique, from both men and women, not just ""gym bros"", LOL, so I can't be doing too bad. I don't think I'm bad-looking, have been in short-term relationships in the past, though I am currently single - still looking for ""the one"", LOL. Some things I didn't get to experience much of or feel like I am behind on, especially now that I'm in my late twenties: * I don't really have any close friends. I have plenty of acquaintances from school, work, gym, etc. Honestly, I prefer peace, quiet, and doing my own thing - I'm admittedly more introverted, though my job requires a lot of extroversion, having to speak to others all day. ""Friends"" mostly just serve to bring drama, jealousy, potential backstabbing which I certainly don't need or want - I don't think there's anything wrong with this at all, it's just something I've noticed. It seems like a lot of Gen Z folks are having fewer close friendships nowadays? * I don't have social media except for reddit and LinkedIn. Honestly, outside of my hobbies of making and saving money (which I can't really share to anyone in real life except my family), watching films/tv shows, working out and browsing the internet I'm quite a boring individual so I don't have much to post on social media anyways. * Related to the previous point, I don't have Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, that most of my generation (Gen Z) has.... * I honestly haven't travelled much at all. Am I missing out? **I guess my questions to everyone is:** 1. **At 27, am I still considered ""young"" overall?** 2. **Do you think I still have time to have ""fun""?

I cant be the minority that thinks thats absolutely ludicrous right? I feel so much empathy for people who are just entering the workforce around 18 years old knowing they have to slave away for 49 years minimum. Now I know people will start saying Tough luck, get a better job and save better so you can retire earlier. And I get that, but Im talking in a general sense, most people are living this kind of life. Work a job they hate for 49 years until they finally hit that pension. A 60+ year old working 80+ biweekly just doesnt sit right with me at all. In an ideal world I would say the age of 50 would be that fine balance between at least being able to enjoy the fruits of your hard earned labor instead of some years wasting away in a nursing home. I remember back when the age of retirement was 65 (still old as heck), but the fact that the government increased it by two years because the average human lifespan was increasing, and that makes me sick. People are living longer, and instead of us trying to enjoy those extra small years, the government saw that as a golden opportunity to milk more labor out of the common people.

GenZ,2025-07-11 22:19:06,Being short in 2025 is hell,"Its crazy how society only accepts confidence when it comes from someone who already fits the mold: tall, rich, attractive. When a tall guy or someone with status speaks his mind, hes called confident, assertive, admirable. But when a short man does the exact same thing when he sets boundaries, carries himself with pride, or refuses to shrink himself hes labeled arrogant or delusional. Its like people expect short men to know their place and stay quiet. The moment we show a shred of dignity or self-worth, were mocked for being insecure or trying too hard. Even worse, people gaslight us by pretending height doesnt matter, like were imagining the rejection, the disrespect, the way our presence is constantly downplayed. They say just be confident, while also punishing any sign of confidence that doesnt come from someone they already admire. Theres no winning. If you're quiet, you're weak. If you're proud, you're arrogant. If you complain, you're bitter. But staying silent doesnt make it easier, it just keeps the cycle going. Real confidence shouldn't be exclusive to those who already have power. Short men deserve to be respected when we carry ourselves with pride, not dismissed for daring to exist boldly. Edit: I also wanted to mention the most successful short people are people who are extravagantly successful in every other aspect of their life. By that I mean they usually have tons of money, looks,Fame,talent,intellgence just a general plethora of extremely positive things to lay back on which kind of just goes to show. You have to put in a lot of extra effort into everything else in your life if you want to be successful as a short person",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lxk4rc/being_short_in_2025_is_hell/,0

This results in some ethical debates as well you use these websites and give it information that you wouldnt tell your closes friends. On top of that it is impossible for there to be competition as if you had a choice between two companies that are free you would pick what is something that you have always used.

GenZ,2025-07-11 03:17:41,Hot Take: I actually liked the pandemic,"Everyday, I see people here and beyond talking about how detrimental the pandemic was to society, particularly Gen Z, but the truth is, I personally really liked the pandemic. Now obviously I did not like the deaths that COVID brought. Instead, I will be discussing the lockdown it brought. This is all my personal experience, although Im sure theres some that will relate. Essentially, my life wasnt that different from the one the pandemic brought upon the rest of the world. All my life, I had been bullied at school. I hated going outside, and while I did enjoy school, I would have preferred doing it online. When the lockdown came, it was heaven for me. The whole world got to see and experience the world through my lenses. It was nice knowing people knew what it was like to be home all day, to cut constant interaction with others. Not having to go outside. Staying home all day long, being safe. And I made more friends online than I would ever have made in person. The pandemic basically helped me, gave me some peace of mind. People always complain that the pandemic ruined their social lives, but COVID did the opposite to me. To this day, all my friends are online friends, simply because no one ever wanted to hang out with me physically. And Im okay with that, having unconventional friends is better than having none. Lastly, the pandemic was just a very fun time for me. Having so much time meant more time to explore new things, which for me included making YouTube videos. And while I dont do that anymore, I never would have even considered that had it not been for the spare time the pandemic brought. And quite frankly, if another pandemic happened, I would feel the same way. I know many people will disagree, but I do honestly think people only talk about how bad the pandemic was and forget about any good things that may have occurred during the time.

I don't feel so much societal pressure to have a kid as I expected to, which is a great thing for our generation, but I'm really confused about whether I want a baby for the right reasons. I've always been incredibly maternal, and couldn't wait to be pregnant/become a mother growing up. I have a natural affinity for children and have felt very at peace dealing with babies and young kids since I was barely a teen myself. For many years I've been convinced I wouldn't have them, mostly due to state of the climate, national economy, maternity packages in the countries I'd have an opportunity to raise them in, and personal/family history of both myself and my partners' mental health. I've suffered with depression in the past and have come along way but still feel this undeniable base level of sadness/unfulfillment. I've worked hard and gained a fair few qualifications, done lots of voluntary work, and have a great support system of family and friends, i.e. I've taken the obvious steps alongside having rewarding hobbies and years of therapy to feel ""whole"" and enjoy life, and this feeling had been part of reason I didn't want to have kids, but I'm wondering now whether it's exactly the reason I should. I'm quite confident that having a child would give me a purpose in life and help to light up my world, but this always seemed like a really selfish and arguably inappropriate reason to do it. However, I'm now wondering whether it's entirely natural that I would feel this way as our innate urge to procreate does still exist in most of us, and perhaps there's nothing wrong with requiring this element in life to feel fulfilled.

It made me think about how the game felt when I first started playing. Also a conversation about the MegaMan BattleNetwork series at work sparked up, which got me in the nostalgic mood. It's insane that a few of you weren't alive when I was playing the 1.4 beta in 2011. The game had a large following even before release. Redstone was fairly new, and I think piston's were just released. I remember staying up trying to figure out how to make double doors open with pressure plates at the *same* time. I don't enjoy that the caves now seem overly ubuiqitous, like a chore to venture, rather than a treat to find. I remember the old trick, where you had to press f11 (I think) and one of the graphs would spike in the direction of the cave. The content surrounding Minecraft was also semi-pleasant. [Like when Carl from The Walking Dead played Minecraft](https://youtu.be/WzZXbtr1dMs?si=hCMnrM47nnJn0Y1p). Back when you had to get frapps (or find a cracked version) before OBS became known or was available. I'm happy the community exists still, and new things are being added to it to this day. It even more pleases me that legacy versions ([like 1.4 beta](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_Beta_1.4)) are available for easy download. Anyways, just feeling nostalgic, wondering if anyone else has such a pleasant memory like mine. Frapps wasn't pleasant though. OBS is a f*cking God send.

Normally I would definitely just decide she doesn't want to hangout with me and move on however there are some factors that stop me. 1. I'm almost positive she's not lying about being tired, we work nightshift at a decently physically demanding job and she's works a fuck ton of overtime (the past 2 weeks she's worked 55+ hours each week) and I know how much nightshift can drain you even if you have normal hours.

Growing up I felt as if there were more niche things, people in their own circles whether they were punks, jocks, nerds or whatever. However all these groups actually had something in common which was that they found superficial and materialistic things quite lame. I remember girls and female celebrities being tired of reality tv stars, and there was growing concern about what social media would do (which... wow the old people finally got one right!). Sure some of that hate could be jealousy, but I don't think it was the foundation for criticizing desperate fame. But that desperate fame seems more charming to people now. Like if that's what they have to do to get that bag, go for it. Most art depicted the folly of greed as well. Apart from political condemnation of billionaires, praise of wealth and materialism seem higher than ever. And in fact criticism of that very much makes you the party pooper. It feels like the rich kids at school won, everyone wants to be Regina George not Cady. Most things are treated the way women use Halloween costumes, IT HAS TO BE SEXY. If something is goth it has to be sexy goth. Sexy nerd. Sexy poet. Sexy entrepreneur. Sexy painting. Sexy dancing. Sexy sex. I can't really think of who could be the Bill Hicks or George Carlin for gen z, the types who took a sledgehammer to the commercial culture of America. Maybe Bo Burnham, but he was quite ineffective and tame. I don't think we have to be mean to current icons but I do think we need some counterweight here. I also used to think Americans were uniquely superficial, until I got into kpop and learned a little more about the current culture for young people there lol. Mexico is changing closer to us too, to my surprise Japan also seems more superficial given that these types of conversations don't tend to happen at all there.

GenZ,2025-07-09 03:17:34,The reason why immigrants are being frowned upon,"When you have people flooding into a country with no initiative to assimilate to the values and culture that country was built upon , the cultural climate of that country starts to change. White people arent the only ones worried about this but A lot of African Americans are coming to understand how this is impacting us as well. A lot immigrants come to place where ethnic enclaves are formed so they operate, live and work entirely inside their communities with no incentive to assimilate. Thats why you have Hispanics , Asians etc that have been here 20+ years and still dont know English. The biggest thing upsetting foundational American (those here before mass immigration) Whites (predominantly of English descent) black/African Americans (started being forced here as slaves in the 1600s) and natives (original people of this land). You go to some places like south Florida, Texas , California or New York and are being to made to feel like you dont belong in somewhere where you have historically always been. Many of the groups didnt not start having a actual presence until the 80s or 90s . These groups exhibit clannish behavior. For ex) once they are hired at a company they will hire nothing but Indians or Hispanic, they form communities that have entirely nothing but Asians or Hispanics. They will get in government and start putting policies in place that pushes you out of your community. For ex) Hispanics and California and south Florida requiring that employees speak Spanish. Wonder why the holidays arent the same as they were back in the day. Thats because country values shifts when it so many different ethnic groups here that do not share the same values. I could go on and on and on and on about how illegal immigration and multiculturalism has impacted American but if I did this post would be a whole book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lv8ffi/the_reason_why_immigrants_are_being_frowned_upon/,0

They have the tools in place to get back on track if they ever find a break and are able. They dont understand how its like to be on the other end. They dont understand how fucking debilitating it is hearing them shit talk you everytime they see you eating vegetables, healthier meats, being mindful of fat and sugar. Tracking calories. Its debilitating, not once has anyone in my family ever said they were happy I began exercising or began eating healthy. After years of shit talking me behind my back for eating French fries and burgers and chicken nuggets all the time. I still enjoy these things but Im more mindful of them, in fact I cook them by myself sometimes, as a cheaper and healthier alternative. They dont know how horrible and evil it is to catch yourself binge eating, and have everyone you know not only unconcerned, but *encouraging* you and giving you more sweets and cookies and cakes. Youre not in your right mind, its like taking advantage of a drunk woman. You know how fucked it is, cant even have a single meal in peace without my father or mother or brother walking in going Youre a grown ass man, stop thinking about what you eat like gee, thanks, I dont want to look like any of you. How depressing it is, to have not once heard Im so glad my son is eating healthy/exercising or Im so glad my son has found a way to do it despite his responsibilities its some bullshit or its them using *my* responsibilities as an excuse to tell me to fucking give up.

Of course youre bigger, in face, youre still getting bigger, not in a good way To hear your fatass +300lbs Buffon of a father talk you down because fiber is bad for you apparently, because it Catches food then spits it out, telling you bodybuilders like the rock eat 7000 calories a day to Recover from a measly 2 mile walk. And how I need to eat 5000 everyday if I were sitting on my fucking ass all day not working out. And I ought do 10k because I am. All of this while youre consistently gaining muscle/weight on a lean bulk of 2.7k-3k calories BECAUSE you walk 20k steps a day and lift 3 times a week. They dont believe it How fucking insane it is to have been overweight (175lbs, 20M, 5'8) and *still* considered tiny and skinny compared to the rest of them. Being told Im Sickly and Anorexic at 160, because I knew theyd lose their shit if I told them I was 150lbs. I went from 138 to 147 now after a slow lean bulk over 6 months (Albiet a couple of binging days) and they still dont see it. Im still the eternally anorexic girl-man to them.

I dont understand how you can live being over 200lbs. how I ever lived at my previous weight You have no idea how blessed you are to have someone there to kick you in the ass when youre eating like shit. When youre inconsistent with exercise. It hurts your feelings, sure, but they love you. Thats why they tell you these things. Doesnt mean theyre *correct*, doesnt mean that *Their* way of being healthy is what you should do. But its proof they love you.

I got my education, went back for an MBA etc. I have a relatively low pay, entry level accounting job which for now lets me pursue my hobbies (BJJ,MMA, Lifting) so Im comfortable. More than comfortable actually. On paper, Id consider my life set up to be firmly above average. Im fit, food/shelter secure, eat out relatively often, have childhood friends I speak to semi regularly that still live close by, etc. Maybe I could travel more but thats not really my thing. The point is,Im not really that happy in all honesty. I feel kind of isolated a lot of the time, and I feel like at almost 24 years old, I shouldve developed more socially. My experiences with girls havent been that great, and they dont seem to like me too much. I was recently at a friends 4th of July party, and I think there was a girl that initially had some attraction to me, but my awkward demeanor and lack of social skills kind of killed it. Hinge and the dating apps dont seem to bear any fruit for me, and it just generally seems like I have no avenues through which to accomplish something I thought was a basic part of the human experience: a relationship. That plus the realization that my generation will likely not experience the quality of life our grandparents had due to the state of the world (ai/automation, global politics, etc) has just put me in a weird mood. Like what else do I do? I feel like Ive been checking a lot of the boxes of adulting for several years now, and Im content with my results internally, but externally it seems like it hasnt made much difference. I think maybe a lot of Gen Z guys can relate to this but I havent really discussed this with anyone irl. Just wanted to vent.

My style is basically what many English speakers call bland music, but honestly, that blandness is exactly what I love. For example, I have started liking Alex Warrens songs. I know a lot of people say his music is bland, but to me, that simplicity makes it so nice and calming. I just love simple songs with simple lyrics. I do not really like overdone songs with too much heavy mixing like rap, but I do listen to Coldplay sometimes, and I also watch videos of Freddie Mercury and Nirvana, though I only occasionally listen to their music. It is not that I hate them, they are legends, but when I just want to listen to music peacefully or feel emotional, those are not my first choices. I usually go with songs that are calm and straightforward, including songs in my mother tongue that suit this mood. But now I feel like I already know most of the common songs in this style, so I want to seek your opinions and find some underrated songs that are simple, melodic, and nice. I do not like songs with too much instrumental where the voice gets hidden. I love songs where the bare voice stands out with simple instrumentals. Also, as a side note, I really love songs that start slow and melodic and then go high and powerful in the chorus, like What Makes You Beautiful by One Direction, Carry You Home by Alex Warren, Best Song Ever by One Direction, Stitches by Shawn Mendes, and most Coldplay songs with that type of build up.

In last four years short video content became so common over time. For example on the busses, school breaks, houses and a lot of other environments. It's pretty simple to encounter with them. Lets talk about social media's damages: dopamine is one of the most important brain chemistry. It helps our to feel joyful because it triggers the happines. And people who producted short video content almost know this information more than too many psychologist. Thats why we struggle to give up from them. It makes same thing with a drug because they are both of them getting numb the brain. According to offical searchings, proffesors have explored people's focusing skills are keep reducing since those methods found by some people. Nowadays people are complain about this. The other thing is: Addiction. Being an addict to contents is really terrible. It's make people to miss beauty of life. It does even changes people's mindset until affect the relationships.

So, I decided to major in English. I also believed the sentiment that a degree ""opens doors"", and ""tons of people work jobs unrelated to their degrees"", and that might've been true a few decades ago, but a BA is pretty much the new high school diploma. Also, most jobs I *do* come across don't just want ""a degree"". They want a specific degree (usually finance, business, etc), and multiple years of experience. To be honest, I will also admit, I don't really have any ""hard"" skills. Tons of soft skills sure, I'm good at reading, writing, etc, but these don't really translate to an actual career for the most part.

GenZ,2025-07-05 20:59:24,Are you into film?,"I'm 21 and into filmnot just as something to watch for entertainment, but as an art form. I study film history, the movie industry as a whole, etc. Most people just watch movies for fun and dont really care about film as an art. I love classic movies, especially films from the 1940s to the 1960s. My favorite comedy is *Some Like It Hot*. I recently saw *Jurassic World: Rebirth*, and I didn't like it at all. My theater was full of Gen Z kids, millennials, and parents with little kids. And after the movie ended, they all clapped. This movie was awful. Sure, the CGI was good, three action scenes were solid, and the cinematography was amazingbut outside of that, it was bad. The characters were dull and one-note. You dont care about any of them. You might only like Zora and Duncan, but thats just because they're played by Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali. The plot? A CEO hires a team of mercenaries and a paleontologist to go to an island and collect samples from dinosaurs to cure diseases. Simple video game logicfine, whatever. But then they randomly introduce this annoying family who has no reason to be in the movie. The daughters boyfriends are all insufferable, and whats worse is if the characters didnt literally tell you one guy was her boyfriend, you wouldnt even know. They barely talk. They dont kiss. They dont have any one-on-one scenes. Hes just there. And people *actually* like this movie? Forget compelling, rich characters. Forget strong plotting. Casual audiences just want to be distracted. Thats what gets to me. Because I saw *The Brutalist* last year, and I was the only one in the auditorium. No one came to see this well-crafted film with stunning visuals, cinematography, and *great* acting. But everyone packed out the theater for the new *Jurassic World* moviea film doing nothing new, a franchise that shouldve ended after *Jurassic Park III*. So I want to askpeople who are my age or a little older, like 21 to 25do you *actually* like this corporate slop? Did you skip *The Brutalist*? *Killers of the Flower Moon*? *Oppenheimer*? *Anora*? *Pieces of a Woman*? Do you care about film as an art form? Do you even watch classic films from the '50s and '60s? Are you into film? Like actually into film or do you just watch movies to be entertained?

GenZ,2025-07-05 07:39:25,"My parents have a negative opinion of me, they think I'm a stupid loser","It's clear to me that my parents have a negative opinion of me ever since highschool. I remember one time I went to hangout with some friends and my father said ""use this to practice your social skills""??? As if I never hung out with people before and am a loser. Another time when he introduced me to his friends from work, earlier that day i had a meeting with a counselor for school and my parents attended. My father then said when talking to his friends from work to have a conversation like I just did in school, he literally thinks I have no other conversational experience. Now that I am in college and live by myself for a large part of the year they literally expect me to be on my phone 24/7 or something. When my mother calls or texts me and I'm unavailable at that moment she always says shit that I honestly find to be mean spirited. She says why aren't you responding u just spend all day in your room and on your phone doing nothing all day. She never assumes that I'm outside hanging out with friends even tho that's sometimes the case or anything like that because they think I'm a loser. She also seems to have no faith in me when I want to do something. When I say i go to the gym regularly now she says I'm lying. When I say i want to try and start cooking for myself she sarcastically says sure you will. My father also says I spend all day playing video games which isn't even true, even when I live with them, I was never as big as a gamer as my brother which I think is why they say this about me. There's also the thinking I'm stupid part which I think people from the outside will understand. I've failed classes and because they pay for my college I understand why they are mad at me. However, they have never had faith in me since the start. I do a stem degree and ever since I applied they wanted me to change because they think I'm stupid. Even when it started they asked me every time we called without fail do you want to change you should change its too hard for you. Before I ever failed a class.

I was having a (drunk) discussion with my friends tonight about a girl I was talking to that Im pretty sure was just talking to me in a friendly manner, and then that turned into a convo about whether guys and girls can be friends, and then I was wondering if our generation believes in friends before dating. And see, my problem is that I need to be able to have a somewhat established connection with someone to actually want to date them. Like there are a couple of friends I have/had, that are attractive, but I dont feel compatible with and so I wouldnt date. I even realized last year with one girl, that after liking her when she wasnt available, it was only because I thought she was attractive and because I was just getting desperate. In actuality, we were better off as friends even if she would have liked me back. So I want to make sure I dont fall for a girl Im infatuated with. However, I always hear that a bad thing guys do is hide his intentions or like a friend. And I know everyone is different and situations vary, but its still confusing. I feel like Im lost on how to approach things. Like am I wrong to want to have a deeper understanding of someone before committing to them?

Basically it's an arcade bar with a huge dancefloor and two bars. The demographic that goes to this bar is usually 18-23 years of age. Every time I go I usually just drink and play games with my friends or if I'm the DD I'm just kinda there. I wanna talk to girls but I never end up doing so or it's just very awkward. When I mean awkward I usually will start talking then it usually goes no where. I'm not directly trying to hit on them or saying ""nice tits"" or something. Just saying hi or something I notice in the moment. How do I approach or just start conversations with women at the club without seeming creepy or awkward. For looks I'd say I'm average, I'm five foot ten, and clean shaven Only thing is I don't fit the types of guys that are very popular around where I live.

Theres been a strong slide back towards traditionalism, ignorance, and idealism - for the worst reasons: apathy, lack of critical thinking, inability to take stuff seriously. I feel like it needs to be said : 1) just because something makes a clever meme, doesnt make it true. This is called reductionism. Its when you simplify a complicated situation into a quick sound bite that SOUNDS reasonable, but lacks any real world context. 2) in that same line, theres a lot of traditional values that gen z seem to think are good, because they SOUND good. These can be left OR right. Just because something SOUNDS good, doesnt mean its effective or positive. This goes for stuff that is about the principal, or anything you do because thats how weve always done it. Think critically. Had an argument the other day with a user, who believed a man whos caring for his effectively divorced, disconnected wife with Alzheimers, whos lonely and wants to date, should not do so because he took a vow. Not because it would make the man happy. Not because his wife wouldnt continue to be cared for, or because she was lucid enough to even know - because they liked the imagery of an upheld vow. I know it SOUNDS nice, when you dont break a vow. It SOUNDS nice, when your pinky promise is kept. But this is real life. If youre doing something for the principal, or because of ideals - you may not actually be doing ANY good, except for making a good story no one will ever care to hear. Please think critically. Youre on Reddit, so by default i think I can assume you like data, you appreciate reading well thought out ideas but Thats not even a given anymore. The only guiding principle Ive learned to take seriously, in my time here, is be good to others. Most stuff can be reasoned from there.

I used to be more of a fiscal libertarian but recently I have been trending more towards leftist views. I dont believe in socialist ideas (workers owning the means of production) and I disagree with a lot of their characterizations of economics, but I think that we need to fundamentally realign how our economy functions. Corporations should have more societal responsibilities besides just providing profit to shareholders. And we need to make a sustainable universal healthcare system in America because our current system is disgusting. I feel lost in the current political climate because both parties have elements that I despise. The Democrats arent fiscally leftist and their social vision is something that I vehemently disagree with. And the Republicans have terrible fiscal policies and their social beliefs are bizarre.

I don't think that any human being (that is like by enough people to hold a position of power in such a country for a significant amount of time) would be willing to launch such a war knowing the almost certain outcomes.

I work and live paycheck to paycheck and I am burning out because I dont feel confident about my future here, especially with this Big Beautiful Billmaking its way through Congress.

Examples would be: * **Loot Boxes & Gaming Micro Transactions** \- Fortnite is the most popular example, though there is an epidemic in both male and female oriented video games where this culture is rife * **Crypto:** Targeting tech and finance bro side of Gen Z. Yes, crypto is gambling, don't lie to yourself. * **Sports Betting:** Found in young conservative male spaces. All generations struggle with sports betting, but I've noticed a strong uptick in the past 1-2 years of Gen Z participating in it. * **Blind Boxes**: The real life version of loot boxes - these aren't new, but someone gave steroids to the industry and now there are entire stores dedicated to it like Pop Mart. The most popular blind box brand, Labubu, sold $1 billion worth of goods *this year alone*. It targets primarily girls and young women. There are othertypes of subtle gambling too- these ones just stand out the most to me. I know there are people who have never participated in these types of gambling, and there are probably small groups of people who {quietly} condemn it, but it's not talked about enough within our generation.

GenZ,2025-07-02 00:25:44,What do you think is the biggest difference between Gen Z and Millennials?,"As a Millennial myself I've always seen the two generations as being very similar from a pop culture perspective with the main divider being 9/11, As an 89er Millennial I can only really anecdote from my own perspective and age group. But what the 90s were while living in North America, were peace, prosperity, a gargantuan number of new franchises and lines of toys including video games, board games, card games, and more general electronics like cd players, vcrs, stereos, cds, and a shit tonne of kids movies including disney's white boxed vault movies. The 90s are a long since past but deeply remembered decade where I just felt safe, innocent, perhaps even ignorant. Not JUST because I was a kid, but because we weren't online all the time and the internet we had back then was barely the internet at all. What I think I'll say on that note then is that, Millennials are a generation of nostalgia because we actually had a decade of awesome things to be nostalgic about, but Gen Z is a generation that started in a depressed and rotten civilization from the start. They don't fundamentally understand the loss we suffered. In March 2001 my grandparents were able to wait with me while I, an 11 year old and unaccompanied minor waited for my flight from Florida back to Canada. That doesn't happen anymore. Gen Z were playing as kids what Millennials were playing as teens. In the context of 9/11, that meant war propaganda games like call of duty, halo, time splitters, mass effect, command and conquer, star craft, battlefield, and to some extent grand theft autos as well. Gen Z grew up faster. Because Millennials grew up in a world that catered to kids but Gen Z grew up in a world that catered to adults and wanted you to grow up. This process was sped up by Covid and by the generally more adult pop culture that continues to be cranked out. That's just me thinking out loud.

GenZ,2025-07-01 20:44:36,Gen Z parents truly believe stuff like SpongeBob and Gumball are even remotely adult. Thats ridiculous.,"Its like grasping at straws for internet clout. It is only a desperate reach by mostly the same adults who made or believed in conspiracy theories about Barney, Dora, Caillou and et cetera. Its ignoring what adult content truly means. SpongeBob, Gumball, Bluey, and even stuff like The Owl House, Steven Universe, Gravity Falls, or Fairly Odd Parents, are still in the end kids shows. There is no such thing as a joke that goes over kids heads. Thats a myth. Unfortunately, kids shows have to be so edgy or crude these days just to survive. After the 1990s, society destroyed Hollywood with jam-packs of technology. This AI crap, this 3D crap. Stuff like I Love Lucy, The Flintstones, and even stuff like All in the Family, Married with Children, Friends, or Malcolm in the Middle are tame by todays standards. Back then, they were absolutely for adults (or teenagers at the very least). Content is one thing to judge a show, but marketing is WAY more important. Something like Gumball or Owl House may look or act worse on paper than Regular Show, King of the Hill, Futurama, Shrek, Antz, Beavis and Butthead, Totally Spies, Winx Club, or Glenn Martin DDS but those shows have one thing the others will simply NEVER match adult-ness. They talk about LGBT, say damn or make a fart joke. Dora even makes a sigma male joke. The sex trafficking in Gumball. The panty raid in SpongeBob. Whatever. Does not make a show any more for adults. No one calls Sesame Street an adult show because of a Trump joke, Katy Perry incident, or Elmo saying hell. Because its freaking stupid, ridiculous, and flat-out disgusting/disrespectful. Comparing it to stuff like The Office or Top Gear is insulting to kids shows and actual adult shows alike. 95% of kids shows have more adult content than The Flintstones, The Jetsons, all those other Boomerang shows or even pre-2007 Simpsons. But that still doesnt make them adult shows. Not by a long shot. Theres a reason no one markets Gumball or Bluey to 30-year-olds, and a reason no seven-year-old is quoting BoJack Horseman or Futurama. Lets stop acting like a fart joke or a PG-level insult gives a kids show ""adult cred."" It doesnt. Let kids shows be kids shows.

When I told him that my mom told me it can be pretty entertaining for adults, he said it's fine to wear around the house, but not in public or on a date with a woman. I'm 25. I didn't know SpongeBob was just for kids. I mean literally their show is rated TV-Y7, which means it is generally suitable for ages 7+, and the movies are even more crude (rated PG, sometimes bordering on PG-13 especially with the first and third movies). Going by this logic, a shirt depicting a main child character from The Simpsons (Bart, Maggie, Lisa) or Bob's Burgers (Tina, Gene, Louise) is for kids too. Right? Even Bart who asks, ""Who the hell are you?"" I mean Mr. Krabs literally made a joke about a panty raid.

The problem is, I know I'm probably going to crash out too and I'm just as much part of the problem as they are. Ever since I was a kid, the idea of aging and becoming older scared me. I don't know if it was a mix of nostalgia, wanting to stay in the past, fear of responsibilities in the future, etc or whatever it is, but I just don't understand why we've normalized it to think that 24 is old or anything past 18 is ""unc"" status. It's honestly ridiculous, your life starts in your 20s and we're way too young to think that our prime is over. I just know it's bad because most people my age feel the same way too and I always have to make it clear to people that I'm 19 even tho I'm turning 20 in a few months just to really milk being a teenager for the time being lol.

Because like 80% of bars can't pay rent, they've gone from selling a good time where alcohol is an amplifier, to selling overpriced drinks just so they can stay open. Consistent with the economics that the cost is always passed onto the consumer. So if rent was just controlled everywhere to a reasonable price then everyone's problems would be fixed. Bars can go back to being a fun place, the people can stop worrying about how much rent is due, corporations can stop milking New Yorker's for everything they have, and the city can go back to never sleeping.

GenZ,2025-06-27 14:26:31,The sad Truth about our time,"Ive been having conversations with my fellow Gen Z coworkers, and something really stuck with me. People from past generations always talk about how, back in the day, employees used to sleep under their desks because they stayed so late and came in so early... making sacrifices to get that raise or move up the ladder. But heres the truth: it wasnt just about work ethic. It was about payoff. Those sacrifices used to be worth it. If you stayed loyal to a company for 3, 4, 5 years, youd get that salary bump... and 40K could actually buy you a house, support a family, maybe even let your spouse stay home. You could live, plan, study, build something. That reality doesnt exist anymore. Now, people arent staying late because theres no incentive. Most of us are just working to survive to not end up homeless. Millennials and Gen Z arent lazy or entitled. Were exhausted. We leave early because were going to our second job. Because after those 8, 9, 10 hour shifts, we still have to cook, clean, manage life... So instead of blaming younger generations and asking whats wrong with them, maybe we should be asking companies: Why arent you paying people enough to live on just one job? Thank you for starting this conversation. Lets keep it going and lets redirect the frustration where it belongs: toward building systems where people are paid enough to live, grow, and actually have hope for the future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1llv946/the_sad_truth_about_our_time/,545

GenZ,2025-06-27 00:07:31,Wanted to put the Christian Gen Z folks on to something that helped me significantly,"(Quick note, my goal with this post isn't to debate religion, its solely to reach those who are like me and my husband who might benefit from this knowledge, if it doesn't serve you, thats okay and you are still valid) I've noticed over the years, starting in 2018, or so that most of the Christian folks in our generation hold alternative beliefs surrounding Christianity. It drives us away from churches and a lot of times away from Christianity as a whole. Some of the thoughts I hear commonly expressed: - The Bible feels inauthetic due to the vast amount of edits and mistranlations - I was heavily shamed in Church for asking questions, having doubts, or not fitting into strict indentity norms. - I was made to feel like an insignificant and insufficient cog in the machine - I can't be a part of something that spreads so much hate and bigotry - I feel connected with the spirit but not with the teachings in church - I believe that many religions and spiritual practices hold validity - I have personal practices that bring me joy that are shamed by the church - I have religious trauma All of these are true for me, and for the longest time I resigned myself to being a solitary practitioner, which was lonely and isolating. Then by chance I was told about Unity Church by the person cutting my hair at the salon. Unity: - is a Christ focused Church that doesn't interpret the bible literally (its not meant to be) and incorporates ideas from several texts that were written out of Christian doctrine by the Court of Nicea - teaches lessons from multiple sources, philosophies, other faiths and spiritual practices that compliment the original teachings of the early church - Believes that the goal in life is to discover ones own divinity, and that being Christlike is obtainable by all - Believes that through lifting up the induvidual you lift up the community - Is open to all regardless of race, religion, spirituality, ability, sexual orientation, and gender presentation. Unique indentities aren't just welcome here, but are celebrated here. - Is jam packed with some of the happiest, kindest, most altruistic people I have ever met, everyone feels like a friend from the moment you first speak to them - Is very active, constant workshops, volunteer opportunities, book studies, dinners, movie nights, etc. Its all either free or they do something called ""love offerings"" where you pay only what you can afford - Every cent that goes to the church is put back into the church and into the community - Personally saved me and my family in a really dark time in our lives and walked tirelessly with us for a whole year, helping provide for us every step of the way, never asking anything in return or treating us like a burden. Despite us only going there for a month prior they treated us like their own family. And! Unity is an International Organization with 650 churches worldwide, if you live in the US its very likely there is one near you. The problem is, not many young folks are aware of Unity, the bulk of the congregation at our church is older folks, middle aged to 80's. Im part of the Next Generation of Unity group at my church which has about 10 people, and last Sunday we were talking about this issue. Our generation, despite social media, can be very isolated. We know that there are more folks out there like us that just haven't found us yet. We want to be able to share this community for generations to come, and continue to grow so that people can know they aren't alone in their journeys, and had the benefits of authetic human connection that is so hard to come by now-a-days. TL;DR: I am inviting you to a Unity Church near you, if you happen to be around Richmond, VA, you may meet me on Sunday lmao",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1llfu4o/wanted_to_put_the_christian_gen_z_folks_on_to/,2

It suddenly opening up 5,000 miles of new frontlines to defend. It doesnt just simplify, it creates entirely new challenges we have to face. Sure, technology has advanced in the last 25 to 30 years, but so have concepts, theories, and ideas, along with several breakthroughs in math and science, making what were learning more advanced and complex than what they studied, to simply put it were just not learning the same things and all Tecnology does is make it easier to do what they found hard. Don't get me wrong they had it hard for their time and what they were learning was also brand new back then and they lacked the resources we now rely on, but what they had was just enough for what they did and what we have is also just enough for what we do and the same would go for every other generation. So by the time Gen Beta(these 2025 mf) gets to university, around 2043, what were doing now might be the basics to them, but theyll also their own complex challenges. I imagine them doing things like: cellular programming, where AI designs DNA to editing life; Artificial Law, were they deals with legal questions around AI and machine consciousness even having laws for sentient robots; and orbital engineering, were they build massive mega-structures in space, all thing that would require atleast a PhD to do now they'd likely be doing that for the undergrad.

Rights groups say 60 people were killed in the police crackdown on the protests last year. Their 'crime' was to demand a functional and just nation. The initial spark was opposition to planned tax hikes (intended to please the International Monetary Fund). But 25 June 2024 is now seared into the national consciousness as a symbol of state violence and repression. However, it has also become a day symbolic of resistance and of commemoration for the young revolutionaries who gave their lives. The harsh economic realities that first drove Gen Z onto the streets haven't improved. Up to a million young people enter the job market in Kenya every year, yet the majority do not secure employment. Healthcare remains largely inaccessible to the majority, and approximately 36% of the population lives in extreme poverty. Meanwhile, the gap between the 'haves' and the 'have-nots' keeps widening, fuelling frustration and unrest. Kenyan MPs remain some of the world's highest paid relative to the country's GDP. They push for higher wages for themselves, despite nearly every corner of the capital Nairobi's business district - where the parliament sits - reminding them how hard life is for young people: homeless, glue-sniffing, intoxication and begging. Approximately 75% of Kenya's population is aged 35 or below. This youthful majority is determined to reclaim the country and steer it onto a path that truly serves and works for the common man.

Criticize the wars, challenge the policies, question the system thats our right and responsibility. But dont dehumanize the individuals who bear the physical and emotional costs of those decisions. Veterans and active duty service members are not monoliths; many return home disillusioned, become activists, or speak out against the very institutions they once served.

Its super inflationary and will provide disproportionate disposable income. Every dollar Ive ever made has been taxed and salaried roles are exempt from overtime. If you studied for years to land a job paying 80k, a bartender making 60k with tips will now have the same disposable income as you after tax. I also think youre going to see a ton of employers switch to overtime models with lower base wages. Wealthy people who make 250k+ on 60 hour weeks are going to make out like bandits with 50% of their income dodging tax. Depending on how the law is interpreted, which I imagine will be vague, bonuses may qualify as tips however this is speculation. Overall I think its a terrible idea.

Many of us grew up in the midst of the 2008 financial/housing crisis, losing homes dealt with the stress that followed. Many of us got hit with Covid in high-school and college, killing our opportunites, especially internships. Now many of us find ourselves with dwindling post-grad opportunities because the entry level is gone, replaced with AI. By the time I graduated, I had over a year of experience in my field through internships. Now I'm nearing three years of experience and I still can't find an entry level job in my field. Ive submitted hundreds of resumes and gotten one call. About 85% of my friends got employment through knowing someone. The job I work to make ends meet is one I got through nepotism. The job market is completely cooked right now. ATM I'm trying to ""reskill"" so I'm taking courses about AI to get certs. The worst part about reskilling is that everything is changing so rapidly, that whatever I learn could be completely irrelevant in the near future. Not that there isn't value in learning for learnings sake, but I really want employment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lk6eo8/ranting_about_the_job_market_and_gen_z_struggles/,64

GenZ,2025-06-24 22:35:39,I feel bad that thanks to the pandemic I have friends,"The lockdown was a neutral era for me, what really impacted me was the post covid. When I started to have hybrid classes and then precensial classes, I met someone who became a close friend, and thanks to him I have my own circle of friends I didnt have in this way. Before the pandemic. I was learning how to make friends and connect with others because it wasnt until sixth grade when I started to feel comfotable in my group and not like an outcast who had a funny friend who didnt take her seriously sometimes. the reason why I felt more comfortable was because new students arrived and also because the parents talked to their kids about my diagnosis that got discovered (autism) just a few months back (My parents at first only told the teachers of my autism but in sixth grade thats when it was told to the other parents). From sixth grade to eigth grade I started developing my social habilities and having school friends, but there was a burden. **My attachemnt with people who were 2 years older than me** In 2016 i met guys who were 2 years older than me and I started to approach to them because I felt comfortable and happy with them and also I was in love with one of the guys. One day in a valentines day bazar this guy and i decided to had a fake wedding (Bazaars have this type of game). but i kissed him, and days later the the guys I met from that group and other people told me ""there's the guy you like"". In my Kid head i thought i ruined his life (even though i didnt and were just goofs from his friends) and tried to stop that by telling the teacher, or ignoring what they say. In fifth grade i still had an attachment to some people that were 2 years old than me because they paid me attention before, I apologized officially to guy i liked but i started to search him a lot and caused that the teachers told me that i couldnt approach to him. in sixth grade I foucued more in being with my generation, talking outside of them sometimes but not quite much. But boy in seventh grade, i did some mistakes. I started to hang out with a group of people 2 years old than me who were just goofs and laughs sometimes mean, i didnt notice this at first because they were kind but then, some of the people were ""off"". at least i feel proud someone actually apologized, that I hanged out with this people part of a semester and then bye bye, and in that semester i also hang out with a group of kind girls of my generation during lunchtime, and even i tried to be friends with a new kid!, the second semester i tried to dose my time and be with the correct people, like that group from my generation, some people 2 years older that were kind to me. because I wanted to form a bond with my generation but also be with the people that in those times i admired, it must be said i commited mistakes and hang out with the wrong ones, but i tried my best. **Why I feel guilty of this attachment?** I feel guilty that I had a crush and had an attachemnt to people that were 2 years older than me (Of course I wasnt attached to the whole generation). because I feel that if it werent for my stupid attachment I would have gone better, but then I say ""if it wasnt for your old crush you wouldnt have started to sing and live beautiful moments and met beautiful people"", ""If it wasnt for your old crush you wouldnt have started writing poems, yeah they were bad, but you did something unique"". I also dont try to blame myself too much, I was just a kid who didnt knew all of this would happen. But sometimes i wish I could go backtime and hang out more with the good people in general. because i hear many people saying that ""2015-2019 were the best"" and I feel bad for not saying the same, those years were me finding who I was, being alone in school, and having as friends the cartoons on tv. that in this era of chaos, that since 2022, I feel great.

A lot seem to live paycheck to paycheck, for a variety of reasons. People don't have a ton of money to throw around early in their careers and the temptation to go into high-interest debt is stupid high. I used to be big on using credit cards to pay for everything, but I got into the reverse budget method of managing my money. Basically, my paycheck hits savings account #1. Savings account #1 feeds into savings account #2. Savings account #2 transfers $54 a day into my checking account and transfers the rest into accounts that pay my recurring bills (e.g. rent, utilities, phone bill) either directly or through a credit card, as well as some savings accounts dedicated to future expenses such as my next car. Everything's completely automated. The only thing I see day-to-day is the $54 coming into my account every day. All of that's through Capital One, plus $3,000 of my emergency fund. I also have a savings account with Western Alliance with the other $6,000 of my emergency fund. They give a higher interest rate, but it takes much longer to transfer money out. I have shied away from using credit cards for everything. I think it's good to use them a little to maintain my credit score, but they take a chunk of your transactions even if you pay on time in full. Debit cards do this too, but at a lower rate. It all seems a bit parasitic to me. It's also nice to know that the money in my debit account is... money in my debit account. I don't really have to do mental math to see how much I actually have, which I find very satisfying. But obviously this isn't optimal -- or even viable -- for everyone everywhere. An Uber driver, for example, doesn't have the luxury of having the same amount of money hit their account every 2 weeks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1ljc01d/what_strategies_have_yall_been_using_to_manage/,0

Some of my mates in a trade school across my college are planning on having a wife by 23. Which does sound insane, especially in this economy. I don't really know what their situation is and I don't pry into that stuff with them, just want to hang around and have fun instead. That being said, hearing them talking about all this ""family is great"" , ""I'd love to have my own kids"" or ""Once I'm out, I'm putting a ring on it with my girl"" stuff. I just don't understand why people want families at all.

I'm with my dad and he pays for my tuition, I'm well off and couldn't ask for anything more but he in a different spot. Job's hard, boss is always an utter stuck up, families in tatters, have to work day in day out 6 am to 5pm, then going home to an apartment in some alleyway instead of his actual house (he's here to help me settle down, can't seem to think I can live on my own) . Generally, miserable life for a man almost in his 60s, still busting his ass of for me. While I'm grateful, I never understood why anyone would want to be in his position. In my eyes, I see him as the average man, hard working, diligent and miserable, down on his luck if you will. I can't think of any sane person who would want to spend their entire life being in his shoes, he's a good man, yet life keeps kicking him down a peg and i'm not making his life easier, college is expensive and he needs rest, his body is giving out and soon, he has to retire. Having to deal with that kind of responsibility, sounds like a nightmare, freedom gone, stress off the roof and needing to take care of so many things all at once, and if one thing goes down hill they all fall down together. And for what ? For some kid to maybe make it big in life and might not even give you back your money's worth, all that effort, that sacrifice just so you can maybe have a chance of essentially winning the lottery. Seems like an utter scam to me, doesn't make a lick of sense. As far as I see it, family isn't worth it, not when you're poor (which most people are). If you're rich, the yeah, go crazy, have 3 kids if you want. But the rest who seriously wants a family in this days and age needs to re check their situation cause you might be getting yourself into something you aren't ready for.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lj885w/feels_like_having_a_family_is_an_utter_scam/,6

GenZ,2025-06-24 05:07:32,The surge of conservatism among Gen Z is a contrarian position rather than a deep political devotion,"Preface: The purpose of this post is not to deny the existence of deeply conservative Gen Z individuals. It's definitely a thing. With that said I'd like to acknowledge that there are a multitude of reasons a Zoomer may choose to support right wing ideology. My main - I guess you can just call it a conspiracy theory - is that youth culture follows a natural trend of contrarianism much to the dismay of the status quo. It's easy to forget just how unpopular it was to be a hippie in the mid 1900's. But eventually, the culture did shift. Now I'm not saying everyone wanted to be a full-on hippie... but hippie-adjacent. There's probably a better word that I am blanking on, but just look at 70's culture and you'll see what I mean. And if I had to construct a crude timeline here, I'd then say we went from hippie culture to punk culture to gangster culture, and it just feels like we're hitting the expiration date on the whole anti-conservative concept. I could be tripping here, but I also feel like 2015-2020 was sort of the ""dying gasp"" of the mainstream left. I'm not saying leftist media is dead. Actually on the contrary, it feels like it is finally evolving and getting some teeth, for better or for worse. But my point is that I think the a lot of conservative personalities made huge strides in capitalizing off of (what they portrayed as) arrogance within leftist media circles (I.e. feminist freak out YouTube compilations probably helped radicalize an entire generation of vulnerable teen boys. Don't ask me how I know.) I know there's probably holes in my logic and plenty of counter examples, but there seems to be a growing sentiment about conservatism among Gen Z, so this is just my theory. Let me know what you think.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lj2kgm/the_surge_of_conservatism_among_gen_z_is_a/,688

GenZ,2025-06-24 04:04:42,"I feel sorry for you, misandrists","I sympathize with you because you feel so much hatred for many because of the negative experience you've had with a few. Not to be conceited, but I rationalize it like how someone will develop a phobia of dogs. They come across a violent dog that hurts them, now they're scared of any dog. It makes sense. HOWEVER The generalization of ""all men"" doesn't do good for anyone. No generalization is good. If your goal is to dismantle the patriarchy, you're just enforcing it by asserting ""all men"" are (insert negative generalized characteristic of men) which is probably a generalization in the first place because of toxic masculinity, therefor enforcing the patriarchy. If we want to dismantle the patriarchy, we need to get rid of all negative stereotypes and reinforce positive traits. p.s. even if a man is ""one of the good ones"" they likely still find it grading. It makes people less likely to open up about their bad experiences in general EDIT: This comes across very patronizing. I'm sorry for that, it wasn't my intention even though re-reading the title alone gives me the impression that it is patronizing. My goal with this post was to express my discomfort with generalizations. I think everyone deserves to be seen as an individual, not a stereotype. The logic that ""the good ones"" know they aren't the problem and don't get offended is unfair. It implies that if a man is anything other than silently agreeing, he's complicit. Part of the problem. But it's human to feel bad when you're criticized, even indirectly.

Shell know its AI, of course just a way to keep the conversation going and stay with her when I can't. Meanwhile, the AI keeps track of what she shares and sends me little summaries of highlights or concerns, so I can check in every day and talk about the things that matter most to her.

My last 2 years have been really hard for me in college, I was often lonely but I finally feel like I have connections now. But my last 2 dorms lowkey give me bad memories because not only was I lonely and spent too much time inside. But also because they were bland and not cozy at all because I made little effort. I am also trying to get a gf and I want it to be a place where girls would like and feel safe and welcoming if I invite one over. One of my closest friends in college is a girl and she took me shopping with her once for like crystals or something, maybe i can ask her for advice. I already have some art and decorations, I plan on getting more but most of these are really colorful. I want the space to be colorful and full of life (i like that style) but not too much or an eyesore. I also plan on getting a mood lighting lamp which in my opinion looks cozy. I'm also thinking of getting a fruit bowl to put on the table, my mother always does this in the kitchen and it's nice. For the couch i should also get some cute plushies (i already have some) and a nice comfy blanket. I already have a blanket for my bed of course, I think it looks kinda pretty but it could maybe be more comfortable. But I don't wanna waste money on something I already have some maybe I should just get a really nice one for the couch. Furthermore obviously I should keep it clean, but I don't want it to feel sterile or lifeless. I like homes that feel lived in.

People live their lives vicariously through their phones and social media, staring at them like zombies all the time and getting dumber day by day. I feel more and more left out and overwhelmed by all this, to the point where I don't even feel like I'm from the same generation, and there is a gap between me and others, that's why I don't have any friends, social media, smartphones and now AI have destroyed all that and the future from my point of view. When I say I'm not on social media, I'm the freak show and people ask me ridiculous questions like, ""What do you do on the weekend then ? How do you live ?"".

By now it's pretty clear that Iran was trying to build nukes, there's no other reason to enrich uranium to 60% levels. It's too dangerous for them to acquire nukes, so the US destroyed their facilities and delayed them. I feel like any rational person would agree that this was a sensible move. And yet, everywhere on the internet, even here on reddit, there's people saying this is Iraq all over again and that there's no nukes, it's just an excuse for war. But the US hasn't even declared a war yet, and despite that the anti-US propaganda is everywhere. It's clearly driven by an anti-west agenda, and it's making me think. Everyone says there were no WMDs in Iraq, but what if it was the same situation, where their facilities were destroyed so obviously they didn't have WMDs, because the US destroyed them, and that was the whole point. And then the narrative of ""US bad"" was just spread so much by anti-west bots that it became the mainstream narrative. I'm absolutely behind the US in this case, tbh.

People really felt like they were going to die, including myself. Since then, I have struggled to sleep and am never really at ease, ever. When Oct 7 happened it only made these fears worse. At that time, online calmed me by saying the world is at one of the most peaceful times it can be in. Now, that's simply not true. As the w*r with Iran & Isr*el escalated I have fallen further and furhter into this spiral. Multiple breakdowns, my anxiety is debilitating me and as of last night's news with the US it has only gotten worse. I can't sleep. I am constantly checking the skies. It's exhausting. I have basically accepted the possibility of death on the terms that I can die with my long-term boyfriend. I know it sounds crazy, because it is, but I don't want him to die alone if the theoretical happens. I am, in short, looking for advice on how to handle all this mentally. I know this all sounds crazy. It is what I'm having to deal with. This is my first w*r I'm old enough to actually know what's going on. I know it could be a lot worse and this is probably dramatic but unfortunately it does effect my everyday life.

GenZ,2025-06-22 11:54:52,I don't see the point in anything anymore (but I want to).,"Not to sound emo but this is truly what type of mindset I've been in for the last few years. When Covid hit I was a freshman in high school who had high expectations, I wanted to get into an Ivy League school and do a sport. But then online school hit, and combined with undiagnosed ADHD I basically flunked half my classes for the year and had to take summer classes. It was hard to take because I was a straight-A student who never failed a class before. I felt like I failed my purpose (immigrant parents didn't help lol). Then we went back outside and everyone basically acted like nothing happened. But something changed within me, even though my grades were better than ever, I felt like there wasn't a point to studying something I'm passionate about, because nothing I was passionate about made enough money, nothing is affordable, I'll never be able to buy a house, etc. I went from wanting to make a great living, to just wanting to make a regular living, to just wanting to get by. Reality had hit me and I started focusing on saving money instead. My sophomore year grades were horrible, so I got my associate's degree from a community college and I'm going to be commuting to a regular state school. The reason I'm here now is because I decided to stalk some of my old classmates online. Their lives couldn't be more different from mine-going to top colleges, partying, getting internships, getting scholarships from playing sports, leading clubs, etc. While I was busy coasting by, they kept their grades up and actually got involved. It made me feel like shit because I felt like I wasn't aiming high enough. I know I'm capable of more, I just have the shit work ethic that I've had my entire life. I've had so many projects in the past that just crashed and burned due to my own self-sabotaging. One time I organised an online magazine with a few girls and just completely ghosted everyone from burnout. Over the years I just stopped trying because I couldn't trust myself to stick to anything. Right now, my only motivation is being able to move out with my current boyfriend in the future. Other than that, it's a daily struggle to care about anything I'm learning in college. I'm scared that if I continue down this path I'll just get stuck coasting by rather than developing as a person.

Any politician who does not blatantly support their ideals could have thousands of dollars pumped into the opposing candidate's campaign. Once a politician is in office, lobbying groups are a legal way for benefactors to ""guide"" this politician's legislative decisions, the subtext being ""If you reject our advice, you may not get enough money to win your next campaign"". This is blatant, built-in political corruption. Even politicians themseleves are allowed to invest in companies (or countries!) adjacent to their political allegiances. This is even more profitable for them considering they have insider information on which specific legislation is likely to be passed. **GETTING MONEY 100% OUT OF POLITICS NEEDS TO BE THE RALLYING CRY OF THIS GENERATION.** If government decisionmaking continues to be made primarily based on profit incentive, then EVERY decision will prioritize elite interests, sidelining the rest of us.

GenZ,2025-06-22 00:52:32,"We already know we probably won't ever own a house. Now, many of us probably can't even afford to ever own a car","The American dream is a single family house with a white picket fence and 2 cars in the driveway. As an older gen Z, I've already accepted that I won't own a house, and my car and the freedom it gives me was my last remnant of the American dream that I""m holding on to. But for younger Gen Z's, even a car is becoming hard to afford. I am an older gen z and luckily bought my current car in 2017 when prices were still reasonable. I was able to get a 3 year old Mazda 6 with 40,000 miles for $12000. Gas was $2.20/gallon, and my insurance was around $130/month for a new driver. However, those prices no longer exist. The cost of owning a car has skyrocketed since the pandemic. Today, the same car would cost $22,000. Not to mention labor rates for repairs and insurance have also nearly doubled, which are rates much greater than the official inflation index. Today, if you are a first time car buyer, you have it tough. Besides $200+/month insurance for new drivers, $12000 now will get you a 10 year old car with 100,000+ miles. If you have only $5,000 to spend, you are likely rolling the dice, whereas a $5000 car back in 2017 would cost over $10,000 now. Also, given how many Gen Z are not handy/don't have a space to work on cars, be ready to pay $200 an hour for repairs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lhbh8b/we_already_know_we_probably_wont_ever_own_a_house/,31

Whenever I hang out with her, it always feels like her voice has to be louder than mine. If were trying to figure out directions or something, her way is always the right one. Same with opinions shell say she gets where Im coming from, but somehow her opinion is still the one that actually matters. At the festival, everything basically had to revolve around her and her sister. If they were bored, we left. If they wanted to switch stages, we all had to go or Id be left alone, which obviously I didnt want with how big and chaotic the event was. I just kinda had to go along with whatever they wanted. One thing that really annoyed me: they were napping in the evening and got super annoyed when I wanted to do my makeup in the bathroom because I might be too loud. But then in the morning, when I was sleeping, they were talking loudly, using the bathroom with the door open, and had zero consideration. Or when I really wanted to listen to one specific DJ they wanted to leave me there all alone since they found it boring while I had always stayed with them when they wanted to stay longer. Anyway it felt really one-sided. Idk if its because theyre used to getting what they want (they come from a pretty wealthy family), but the whole weekend just made me feel like I didnt matter. I still care about her, but I dont think Id want to travel or go to big events with her again.

He blames me for never being able to organize anything and says that I never want to do anything, even if it's not true, I only reject invitations to evenings that I don't like, he says that in a friendship you also have to please the other and do things that you don't like. He's never serious, when I bought 2 little fish instead of telling me a simple beautiful one, like the other friend did, he wished them death, and when 1 actually died, he said like I enjoy it or I told you so.

teenagers,2025-07-14 14:18:29,random trauma dump because i just remembered,"i was just walking with my slippers on today and I walked past my cousin and then he started screaming, like full on screeching... he was playing with legos and was pointing at my foot where i could see a little blood coming from... yeah, you see where this is going, there was a lego in my slipper and i was walking with the lego digging into my skin. This just randomly reminded me of my dance teacher for a professional dance company when i was 12, she was supposed to be this amazing, kind woman, but instead she was an abusive wretch. I'd like to say i have a dang lot of trauma and this woman was the cause of more than half of it. The main thing i remember her doing was making us dance on rice whenever we messed up a choreo. This was horrible for all of the girls because she never targeted her 'perfect boys' . To be clear, the dance was a full on, jumping, acrobatic, hip-hop choreo and she would make girls dance on rice as a form of humiliation in front of the whole class till their feet bled. So i remember that one day i messed up for the first time (i was new) and she moved me to the front on top of the layout of rice, it was literally my first day and i didnt know how it worked. She made me jump and dance on the rice and i was bawling my eyes out. In the middle of the dance, she decided to stop the class and made me start doing some kind of acrobatic activity (i think i was roundoffs)... my feet were bleeding . I messed up a few times over a course of a few weeks and then i ultimately decided i was gonna try and be perfect. After like 2 years of being ""perfect"" i was tired of seeing my dance friends bleed every day and cry in humiliation... so i decided to test something, i messed up the choreo by purpose and earned my spot at the front of the class, i then proceeded to do the choreo perfectly on top of the rice and did my best to keep a straight face... i could literally see her burning up from inside, the fact that i was perfect and then continued to be perfect after i messed up was definitely contributing to her anger. She then yelled at me to take my punishment fairly, and i was like lady what? i am? She then called me down and sent another person to the rice. She kept on sending me there the following days even if i wasn't messing up and i kept on being perfect and eventually i got used to the rice and wouldn't even care. I remember one day she was particularly mad because she was done with my 'act' or something like that. And the next she quit and we got a better teacher.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1lznm4h/random_trauma_dump_because_i_just_remembered/,1

teenagers,2025-07-14 14:10:21,I (18 F) am really conflicted about my friend (21 M),"I am 18 F, a first year student of law. Before I pose my problem, let me lay out some backstory. I graduated high school last year with great grades, so I was pretty hopeful abt getting into the uni of my choice. However, under certain circumstances, that didn't happen and this caused me to spiral. I was clinically depressed (and diagnosed) which made me hate having to attend the uni I did get into. I didn't speak to anyone on my own, and I was so dry when spoken to that conversations couldn't really happen, and so I didn't make any friends. At this point, a guy in my class (21 M) started talking to me under the pretext of notes, and I treated him like I treated everyone else- I was borderline rude with how coldly polite I was, I had very dry responses when he tried to make conversation, etc. In retrospect, I was behaving that way bc I had no more energy left to make any new friends. I'm a pretty shy person to begin with, the kind to keep to myself, and the depression was taking a serious toll on me. However, this guy was persistent, he kept finding excuses to talk to me, and within the first two days of me meeting him, he asked me if I'd like to go on a walk after classes. At that point, I would have done rather anything than return home and sit alone and let myself spiral (like i was doing everyday atm) so I said yes. The 'walk' turned out to be a whole trip around the city, and we ended up going to this rly popular tourist spot that I've never been to before. We talked for hours, and while he wasn't the kind of person I'd usually be friends with, he seemed much better by the standards of the rest of my class. This turned into a routine- we'd go out after classes everyday, and find some spot to hang out at- a cafe, the lake, museums and such. I did enjoy being around him, although he still wasn't the kind of person I'd hang out with outside my circumstances. About two months later, during winter break, he asked if I'd like to go to the Book Fair with him. This was the first time he's asked me to hang out with him outside of uni, and I wanted to say no but I thought that's be kinda rude, considering our dynamic so far (and he's been really sweet to me the whole time). I said yes, and that became a whole new routine too. We'd go to the movies, hang out at all kinds of places around the city, and on the surface, everything was pretty platonic. Except, this guy was way more caring and attentive than you'd expect a (straight) guy friend to be. Or atleast that's what my other friends thought when I told them about him. He'd go out of his way to do things for me, being protective, calling me about any uni notices I might have missed, checking up on me. When I was too lazy to do something important that I was supposed to do, he'd call me and bug me till I got my ass up and he's stay on call till I'd finished doing the thing, he'd remind me to take my meds, made sure I ate before classes began, etc. Recently, he's been doing some things that kinda don't feel platonic to me. He holds my hand when we are walking, he'll feed me in public, hug me from the back when we are in a line or on the subway- that kinda stuff. He also started buying me things outta nowhere. Today we had to be at the uni for something important, and we had to wait in line for almost a couple hours. I hadn't eaten in the morning, and I got really dizzy all of a sudden. I walked away from the line and sat down, and passed out almost immediately. When I opened my eyes, he was right there, looking worried out of his mind, splashing water on my face and putting my hair up to get it out of the way. I was still kinda weak, so he stood there with me the whole time, and he hugged me, with my face to his abdomen, stroked my hair and kissed the top of my head. When I was finally able to stand up again and return to the line, he held my hand the whole time and kept asking if I was okay. It made me realise my friends were right- its not just platonic, not from his end atleast. Here's the dilemma- I don't have any romantic interest in him. At all. And I doubt I ever will. But I feel so bad for feeling that way because he is probably the sweetest boy I've ever met, and he does so much for me. He has other female friends too, but he's not nearly as close with any of them. But I also don't wanna lose him as a friend, which is kind of inevitable if he confessed at some point.

teenagers,2025-07-14 13:42:21,A lot of issues men face are because of the patriarchy and misogyny.,"(Quick trigger warning just incase, I do mention rape on here.) Society tells men not to show any emotions except anger, and this has thus resulted in suppression of emotions which has let to higher suicide rates amongst men. Why are men discouraged from showing emotion? Because showing emotion is 'weak' and 'feminine' and the worst thing a man can be (according to society and the patriarchy) is feminine. This is a result of misogyny. Men being raped by women (or other men) isn't taken seriously at all because society assumes that men 'wanted it' or should have 'enjoyed it'. Society says that men are animalistic, hormonal creatures (a reason they use to defend male rapists as well) which is why they should have enjoyed the sex. Once again, a result of a stereotype created by men and propagated by the patriarchy and misogyny. Misandry is also pretty much a result of misogyny. Why does a woman become a misandrist? Because she's been traumatized by misogynistic men enough to start to hate them. If all of us came together and collectively went against the patriarchy and misogyny, literally all of us would benefit, regardless of gender or sex.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1lzmq90/a_lot_of_issues_men_face_are_because_of_the/,1

She said that weve been together for so long that weve sort of lost ourselves in the process and became too dependent on each other, which is reasonable imo. I just feel like empty or purposeless without her. The thing is though she has 2 really close friends and I dont really have anybody else aside from her. Ive got some social anxiety and I feel like everyone just tolerates me and doesnt actually enjoy being around me. This had been getting better at the start of high school because thats when my gf introduced me into her friend group and theyre the first like really good people Ive met, but now that this happened, it all came crashing down and Im back to feeling like how I used to. Nobody else in my life comes close to the bond that we had and when I hang out with my friends it just feels a bit hollow? I spent almost all of my time focusing on my relationship with my gf and not anyone else. I dont know how to feel better, Ive just been in a relationship with her for so long that Ive forgotten what it was like before it. I get done hanging out with people and I just immediately feel sad again and my hobbies just feel like attempts to distract myself from the shift in our relationship.

Everyone worships the ground she walks on. Teachers love her. Boys practically line up to talk to her. Shes confident, beautiful, admired but also fake as hell. Sapphire pretended to be my friend. Shed talk sweetly to me in private, even supported me when I had a falling out with Hazel (her close friend). For a while, I thought she was genuine. But then suddenly... she flipped. Another friend of Shaphire, let's call her Emma, started spreading the most disgusting, made-up rumor about me. Something so vile it destroyed my reputation in days. Im talking the kind of rumor that makes people stop looking you in the eye, whisper when you walk by, even laugh behind your back. And Shaphire spreaded it more as she had a larger 'fan base'. The worst part? Everyone believed her. Just because she's Sapphire. And me? I was left humiliated, hated, and isolated. Even people I shared my lunch with, friends I stood up for turned on me like I was a disease. And this all happened while I was already dealing with hell at home. Controlling parents, no freedom, constantly being mocked or ignored. School used to be my escape. Now it feels like another prison. School is starting from 16th July. Summer vacations are ending. And it makes me anxious to go back to school again. What will I do? I was thinking that I'll spend that lunch breaks in the library reading books. I love reading anyways. But I can't stay in the library forever, can I? Its wild how someone can lie so easily and ruin someone elses life and people will eat it up because of her smile and social status.

The fact that June is the narrator here makes the book even more interesting, since she's obviously justifying herself for all the controversial stuff she did, stating opinions on certain things and even reporting messages, emails, posts and comments word for word, so it's like adding many other one-time narrators to the whole thing, almost forcing you to pick a side, but at the same time making you feel uncertain on which side you are on.

My mom and dad divorced when I was around 4 or 5, and my dad refused to sign the divorce papers so it got taken to court and now I go back and fourth between my moms and my dads house. From what I heard from my brother, he used to hit both of my older brothers and get mad at them for stupid reasons, (both my brothers have different dads that are not in the picture) I heard from my brother that one time my dad shoved my oldest brother against the fridge for making cereal for dinner. I believe I also remember that my dad pulled a gun on my step dad (well call him Garry) Garry came to pick me up from my dads, I was in his car at the sea dogs parking lot (still didnt have consciousness yet because I think I was 5 or 6) anyway, apparently my dad ran up on Garry with a .22 and said something along the lines of Dont you dare lay your hands on him and my stepdad, being THE ABSOLUTE LEGEND HE IS TODAY, said Really? A .22? He mocked my dad as he was getting a gun pointed at him, what a legend. I believe one of the reasons my dad talks and treats my stepdad so badly is because my stepdad had a history of drugs like 10 years ago, and went to jail for it. (Hes been clean since 2015) I believe another reason is because hes jealous that I enjoy being around my stepdad who he always batted me about Hes never gonna be your father, Im your father.

So I thought, what about r/teenagers. Heres what I heard: There is only one god. He is all powerful. He only wishes for happiness in every living soul. There is also another all powerful being, a demon, who only wishes for suffering. When you do good, God can control your fate, when you do bad, the devil has control. Spreading the message is a good deed. Forcing people to is a bad deed. You can love anyone you like, but you cannot hate someone without reason. You cannot cause anyone else to suffer. You can express yourself anyway you like as long as it doesn't show hate towards others, and you are not permitted to misguide any other person.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1lzl403/lets_start_a_new_religion/,1

However, he soon remembered that I didn't finish arguing with a stranger at the internet about the Roman Empire, so he stayed at home to think of what to say. About 30min immersed into his thoughts, he suddenly heard a loud aah noise coming from my son's bedroom. Scared of what could possibly have happened to him, he promptly proceeded to his room in order to assess the situation. i was closed, but not locked, as I opened without resistance when he turned the doorknob. The moment the bedroom came into view, he was appalled, shocked and confused at what he saw. His son was standing butt naked in front of him, with one hand extended towards me, presumably intending to lock me. Son started trying to explain himself in the same instant, but soon gave up, given how easy it was to guess what he was doing. Thankfully, son will soon move out, since he is going to college, so his son will have no need to pretend he didn't see what he saw; nevertheless, it is truly unfortunate that this has transpired.

teenagers,2025-07-14 10:53:09,Simplifying muscles: ABS,"When we talk about abs, we're talking about 3 muscles: abdominal, obliques, and serratus anterior Now, you might've heard people saying ""abs are made in the kitchen"", these people you shouldn't take advice from. Your abs are built in the gym and define in the kitchen, like the rest of your physique How do they work? What's their main function? Abdominal: trunk flexion Obliques: trunk rotation Serratus Anterior: scapular protraction Let's start on where do these muscles even lay? Your abdominal is your ""six pack"", your obliques lay on your ribs, and your serratus anterior are on your first 8 or 7 ribs Now you know the anatomy, how do you apply that to your training? Abdominal: you should have any kind of crunch, ether a machine or a cable, it doesn't matter. Just no leg raises, because they do hip flexion. ""But i feel it in my abs!"" You also feel your biceps doing pull down/up, does it mean it's the best exercise for biceps? Plus, your abdominal is one big muscle, it can't be biased, there's no ""upper"" and ""lower"" abs, who told you that was wrong (if you do actual leg raises with full range of motion, as in raising your legs until your feet is facing the ceiling to round your spine, then it's an ab exercise. If you can't do that, do a crunch) Obliques: any exercise that involves trunk rotation, like a trorso rotation machine (tho, your obliques are in my opinion too small to really effect your training, plus they get hit during any crunch exercise) Serratus Anterior: any scapular retraction movement, like a scapular press on a seated bench press machine (they're a bit bigger than the obliques, which makes them worth training in my opinion. Plus, if you have scapular winging, it can help a lot) How many sets a week? They all should add between 6 to 12 (low volume, high intensity rules) How many reps? Between 4 to 8 (more or less isn't the end of the world, it's simply for fatigue management) How much rest? Standard rule: 3 minutes Now, I'm no expert, I'm just a girl tryna teach you anatomy to build your body. I can be wrong or right, I'm not perfect. If you have a question, i can try to answer",https://i.redd.it/jjuuoejoltcf1.jpeg,2

Why do people want guns completely banned? Most if not all arguments for guns being banned or limitations on which guns people can own are not GUN problems as much as they are MENTAL HEALTH problems. Also NOW over any other time is when people should have guns like an ar15 due to rising government issues. Banning guns would also prevent people who follow the law from protecting themselves. Also criminals do not follow laws. Drug addicts still get drugs, so why wouldnt criminals get guns? Lastly.

Now, she has always been replying a minute or 2 late even for the most basic messages, so it never bothered me despite me texting back immediately almost every time. But the last week I noticed she was replying later and later every day. That's when I found out her new IG account (I know it's her cuz of the picture and full name). I thought ""huh maybe she's gonna delete this one"", days have passed since then and she started getting less active on the older account while the new one was gaining followers every day. I wasn't one of them. Until one day I sent her a text and I got ghosted, 2 days, while the new account was active. So I did what I felt was right at the time and blocked her. I didn't want to, I enjoyed her presence. But at the same time I felt I was taken for granted so I disappeared. There's also a more serious reason that's mainly about me more than her. I'm not comfortable sharing it but let's just say I saw it as an opportunity to make her hate me so when I ""disappear"" she wouldn't be as upset.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1lzizfi/did_i_overreact_by_blocking_her/,2

My parents would usually swear loudly or with strong words I won't write here and often even to me when they're frustrated like the equivalent in my language to ""bitch"" or ""bastard"" or other words that are not really swear words but offensive like ""goat"" that in my language you call someone you think is stupid and this happened in a accademic context. They also said stuff like ""fuck you"" or ""fuck off"" and I'd like to know the opinion of other Italians in this space if that's as common, cause they hurt me but it happens so often that I suppose it's just the way things go.

This was a few months ago, but it came back up a few weeks ago. This girl, K, who I should mention has bipolar ( not that that is a bad thing! it just might be helpful to know ) does not like me. She found out that I had briefly liked her boyfriend ( they were only TWO WEEKS into the relationship, by the way, and I had liked him for a few months prior. ) on the same day of my first and last eighth grade dance. Shed texted me during it, and begged me to sneak her into the danceshes a seventh graderwithout even having asked me if I was okay with it beforehand. I was very very overstimulated at the dance, and I couldnt bring myself to reply. This was when shed started spamming, over and over and over again, clearly fuming. I left her on read every time, on the verge of tears as I sat in the corner of the gym in which the dance had taken place. Her message had started getting more intense, which is where the images take place. After the images; [She also posted on her twitter my face without consent as I was smiling with the caption Pearly whites, but thats unrelated] A few weeks ago, she found out that I showed multiple people what she said to me, and was very very upset. K had started posting threats once more on her stories on her social media directed at me for the next two days, mainly of the idea of jumping me. She was furious, confronting me once more, that she was getting threats in return [that I was not aware of!!], telling her not to fight me. Me personally, I think she did that to herself, but she kept mentioning that she has diagnosed Bipolar Disorder and it was a shitty thing to do to expose her being vulnerable with me to others ( she was referring to her cursing me out and posting my face and whatnot ), and that she was manicalmost like an excuse for her actions.

And now I never open my mouth, and I'm so shy and introverted as hell because I'm worried I'm just gonna turn into my past self, which is the last thing I want. I've improved, but I just keep going back to my old ways and I'm so tired of it. I wish I could just change. Be someone else. Not myself. I just hate myself so fucking much right now. End of vent..

teenagers,2025-07-14 09:09:16,A boob a day keeps the doctor away!,"I was thinking about one thing... sexting has now become quite normal, even if you've only met someone recently. That is, often all it takes is a few slightly more extreme messages and we immediately move towards that level. What struck me, however, is that, unlike what one might think, more girls over 25 are uninhibited than younger ones like 16-18. And the curious thing is that, if you think about it, younger people perhaps have less awareness of privacy, of the seriousness of certain situations... and theoretically they would also have less to lose if something transpired in their daily lives. On the other hand, those over 25, who should be more ""cautious"", seem much calmer in showing themselves, speaking openly, sending photos, etc. Perhaps it has to do with self-confidence, experience, the desire to live one's sexuality without paranoia. When in doubt, if you want to make your day better, a boob in the morning always makes your day better!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1lzhm53/a_boob_a_day_keeps_the_doctor_away/,8

Ive been working on this since September 2024 (mostly pre-production) and really started animating around March. The project was to make a short animated film around a theme this years theme was movement and I chose to focus on Social Movements, like the LGBTQIA+ movement. I had to research, make character sheets, backgrounds, animatics, scripts, colour, editing, etc. etc. all by myself while still doing normal school which was fun, because I love working alone, but definitely challenging. Im so thankful to Good Kid for giving me permission to use their song in my project, and I hope I didnt bother Jacob too much, lol. Around May, some personal stuff happened and I lost all my progress so with only 3 weeks (from May 14th to June 6th) I had to re-animate, render and edit everything. Obviously that messed with the projects quality, and Im really sad about that, but oh well, at least I finished it, lol. Im only publishing it now because I finally presented it to the juries and Im actually allowed to show it to more people. Despite all the difficulties, Im still somewhat proud of what I made which is good, I guess.

teenagers,2025-07-14 07:47:16,sun exposure,"My mother is very ""clean"" and doesn't believe in a lot of data and medical advice. She's very far right and believes doctors are lying and that the sun does not, in fact, cause damage to the skin. I (sadly) cannot convince my mother to get me sunscreen even though I burn very easily. She starts ranting about how sun damage is a myth and that ""it's a whole other story."" I have very different views from her, and I prefer to listen to licensed professionals, and I'm getting tired of listening to her ""natural"" remedies and solutions without medical guidance. The real kicker here is that my father has skin cancer and has cancerous spots removed constantly from his face. He nevers wears sunscreen and I'm really concerned about him. He wears hats, but his skin gets very red and the repetitive doctor visits are becoming ironic when it comes to my mother's advice to him. It really irritates me when he starts talking about said spots and considering that, maybe, it IS unprotected sun exposure, and then my mother cuts the idea down. My mother is also one of the same people that donned the vaccines in 2020 ""propaganda"". I no longer get any vaccines or shots for anything. Not even flu shots. Every time I tell any of my friends, they give me weird looks. Her outlook on things irritates me, but above all else, concerns me. l love her very much, but she believes the medical system and world is after her, even when it comes to something as basic as UV protection? As long as I live under the same roof, my thoughts, opinions, and suggestions will be cut down, and my mother calls me ""brainwashed"" and threatens to take away my phone.

And there I meet this girl right? She seemed around my age, we introduced ourselves and I lowk liked her personality. We didn't really talk that much at the bar, but next day (when we had to go home) that girl's father drove us to the beach, we spend 5-6 hours then and it was pretty awesome, and then we drove home to Bulgaria. Me and the girl (Larry, kind of a weird name for a girl, but I won't judge) exchanged a few words in the car, and at that point I started wondering if I should ask for her number. Anyways, while we drive I got the courage to ask her next time we stop somewhere. She wasn't like a 10/10, but she wasn't ugly either, so I was confident she's gonna say yes. We stop at a store with perfumes and some food. Only problem is, I wanted to ask her when she was NOT next to her father. But unfortunately, she kinda just always walked next to him and I never saw an opportunity.

teenagers,2025-07-14 07:20:45,"Thoughts on Superman 2025 (spoilers, obviously)","I LOVED IT Colors-ABSOLUTELY BANGING Soundtrack- INSANE Jokes- SLAPPED Actors- AWESOME Emotions- OMFG Motion blur- needed a bit more tbh Fight scenes- LOOKED PAINFUL There was a bit too much going on in some parts, but i was never bored. Super dog was fantastic I loved how they portrayed all the characters. I like how superman is goody two-shoes, all he wants to do is help and make sure nobody dies. I love Superman. I could rant about Lex Luthor ALL DAY. I love how he was portrayed as just a douchebag to everyone. He fights Superman purely because he hates them. Everything he does is because of envy. Everyone sees him as a complete loser and crazy person, but his goons would agree with everything he says, but he never is seen as dumb, because he's not. He built a pocket dimension, built a multi-million dollar weapons industry. He acts undoubtedly dangerous and hateful. I love terrible villains. The scene where he knocked the cups off the desk just for his goons to pick them up was funny too, it just showed he was an asshole. And him breaking into Superman's Elsa castle to destroy his robots AND kidnap his dog, AND steal his recording, AND release the FULL version to the public? i hated him! And some of the scenes like where Superman saw the second half of the recording and borderlined a panic attack, his constant looking out for the dog, aggravation at #SUPERSHIT, the mighty crabjoys, all really show he's human and not some completely unstoppable force. I loved seeing him get emotional. THE COLORS AND SOUNDTRACK WAS INSANE. it had total comic book vibes, and if you never want to see the movie, at least listen to the soundtrack. i also like how Gunn made superman's underwear look closer to how they did in the 40's. I also like the more modern ""s"" logo on his suit. The ""Justice gang"" was fun I see a lot of people saying it's ""too woke"" and ""about immigration,"" i guess i could see it if that's what i was thinking about, but it's obviously not what it's about. Superman was always a (literal) liberal, illegal alien, he always looked out for everyone no matter the age, race, species, or upbringing. Him speaking up against Lex was just showing him that he's human and has emotions too, and if you're angry about that, then you probably need to re-watch the movie. Just tiny nit-pick things but the only really lovey-dovey stuff he had with louis was the kiss scenes, which (imo) could have stuck with the flying one at the end. Element man (?) was kind of weird, he didn't take too much convincing to stop the kryptonite directed to Superman, and the tiny baby was weird. I'm just a bit tired of the ""looks like scary but has normal voice,"" we already have Korg, The thing, that's all i can think of rn but i'm sure there's more. Also i wish there was a scene where someone said ""it's a bird, it's a plane, it's superman"" or when he rips open his shirt to show the superman logo. And it would have been nice if it started near the beginning of Louis and Superman's relationship and seeing her find out that Clark was superman (or him telling her.) Also, it might just have been the movie theater, but in a lot of scenes when the camera turned it was very gittery and distracting. Exited for Supergirl's movie, (or just part two) I'd give it a 8.95/10",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1lzfzes/thoughts_on_superman_2025_spoilers_obviously/,1

I was sexually abused by my mom's boyfriend as a kid, and it made me very hypersexual. I ended up getting pregnant when I was 14, and I gave birth to my son nine days ago. I'm 15 now and very overwhelmed by motherhood, but it's worth it for my son. I love him more than I ever thought was possible, and he's absolutely perfect, but sometimes I start worrying that I'll abuse him too, especially when I'm nursing him or changing his diaper. I've never had any urge whatsoever, and the thought is so disgusting I hate myself for it, but it's still a huge worry for me. It's gotten to the point where I get so upset and panicked when I have these thoughts that I genuinely want to die. I won't do it, because my baby needs me, but I don't want to be alive if I'm going to hurt him. I go to therapy for my PTSD, but I'm so disgusted with myself that I can't tell my therapist. I'm scared my baby will be taken away if I tell him. I don't want to abuse him, and I never have, but I'm scared that I'll somehow lose control and do something I don't want to do. He's such a sweet and perfect baby, and I would never do anything to hurt him, but something inside of me says I will, and I don't know what to do.

teenagers,2025-07-14 06:34:26,"""Men are horrible"" statements do not include you if you are not a creep","I'm a guy and I never felt included when woman used a phrase like ""men are horrible"" or ""men are gross"" in response to something horrible or gross some men did or said. Because why would I? I have never done shit like that that. So why would I be included? When using language basically everyone uses some form of generalization when taking about a decent subset of something. Even if not 100% correct, its very much implied that we use language like that to express observed patterns. Even if those patterns are not even the majority its understood when talking to other people that those patterns can vary greatly in terms of percentage and that of course those statements do not imply that every single one of that thing is meant. ""Politicians are liars"", ""Teenagers are always on their phone"", ""Boomers ruined the economy"", ""Cops are corrupt"". I do believe that it would be the best, especially when talking about emotionally loaded topics that being precise in your language would be optimal. But on the other side when woman talk about lived experiences of noticing these patterns over and over, from themselves, friends they have and people on the internet I feel like its understandable they are just really frustrated. And like I said it would be optimal for them to be careful and say ""A very noticeable subset of men are horrible"" instead of ""men are horrible"", but judging by how we use language most woman who say that are implying its about those that do disgusting things and those that enable it. Because of course, most of these woman have some male acquaintances, boyfriends or fathers that they for sure are not including. **And the most important part is, they are not talking about you. If you are not a creep, you are not meant.** *(It would be understandable if a woman would go out of her way to say ""all men are disgusting"", thats pretty undeniable that thats an unreasonable statement to make. But I dont think that is at all common.)* Cant we just give people the benefit of the doubt more? Cant we just not assume the worst interpretation of whatever someone says. Especially when talking about victims themselves, cant we have more empathy that some people are just really frustrated with the world and want to express that? And I really have empathy for anyone who those statements still hurt. It sucks to feel like many people assume the worst of you just because of the sex you were born with. Nobody should feel like that. If you are affected by that, be more kind to yourself. You are not a creep and woman really appreciate guys who are not like the ones they often have to deal with.

I honestly don't fit in anywhere, and everyone makes fun of me, and lies to me, and takes advantage of me when I'm nice to them. It's tiring. I'm this close to just being a shut-in, cause everyone is so discouraging and mean for no reason.

teenagers,2025-07-14 06:10:18,Relationship advice needed,"Well hello everyone i'm coming on here seeking advice from others that may have gone through this or have any advice towards this. I recently have broken up with my boyfriend and i don't feel sad it's been about two days , though maybe i don't feel sad bc i've been hanging out with friends. Anyways we decided to put an end and i just want to know if this is valid? We are young. Whenever we would hangout he'd just be on his phone most the time, he rarely posted me, he hated the movies i loved and would refuse to watch movies and shame on what i liked, i would put a nice outfit together and he wouldn't compliment me , only on the outfits that were tight, or short, basically revealing. He wouldn't ever just simply hug me or comfort me , he would always show affection by hugging my breast or my butt or pressing against me. And if i said no there would be times where he would turn his back on me in bed instead of just showing me physical touch the right way. He claimed i didn't like how he physically looked because i wouldn't want to do anything sexual with him (he literally has a 6 pack). He has body shamed me multiple times. He said when i go to college and go out that he would leave me. He would always expect me to say i love you FIRST which ok that sounds childish but dude if u say bye just say bye i love you it's not that hard im obviously going to say it back. And ever since the whole lust situation i feel i've drawn apart from him , it makes me just not want to do anything with him (i can't even make out with him anymore). And now that we have been on a break/breakup he is upset and saying how he wishes he was desired and wishes i wanted him as much as he wants me. I just feel like this isn't love, i am a huge love person i love the idea of love but this isn't the love i want for the rest of my life, or it even makes me question if this is what love is like?

It's gotten kinda dangerous sometimes because she'll do it when I'm eating so I almost choke or when I'm in front of a hot stove.

teenagers,2025-07-14 04:19:19,I hate my mom <3,"I dont mean this is a rebellious my mom doesnt let me do anything fun type of way, but my mother is a narcissist who doesnt deserve children. My headgear for braces isnt fitting in and we have to go to the orthodontist tomorrow and shes mad at ME and she cant even tell me why shes mad at me and i genuinely cannot wait until i go to college and go no contact with her because she is manipulative and stuff. She is the one who chose the orthodontist that is an hour away when we have plenty of good ones closer. She turned everything around on me and was talking about how i am always on my phone and didnt help her with the dishes today she said she would do them because i was sick. She never even complained until the headgear thing came up. I said something about how I didnt like the orthodontist she chose and she started yelling at me saying dont blame them (he didnt put my spacers in right?) and that i always blame other people for things they cant control. Which is literally exactly what she does because she is a Karen who will literally go up to anyone and everyone in a store and be rude to them if they dont have something she wants. One of the reasons I believe my mother hates me is because of my dead brother. She puts the burden on me. I dont think she ever acted that way before he died (I was 1 what do I know) he died in a car accident and I didnt really know him but she talks about him more than me sometimes and I feel so selfish for being mad when all she does is talk about him. God forbid I tell her these things though, or i genuinely dont think I would make it out.

This past month I have been on vacation staying at a relatives house, and as i have my hair dyed I maintain the color by using a colored conditioner. However, even though I have been very mindful of using only one towel and keeping the conditioner only in the bathroom, the color from both my hair and the conditioner sometimes seeps into the bedsheets and other towels. Because I didnt want to cause anymore damage to my relatives bedsheets and towels, I have been taking showers at the gym. Still, when my mom came down to visit, she saw the stained towels and bedsheets that I had tried to remove and stated that I cant use the colored conditioner anymore, which I totally understand but still feel angry at as I view it as part of my self-expression and it gives me more confidence. Is there a way to convince my parents to still be able to maintain my hair? I know I ruined a few towels, and I plan on paying them back and my relocated showers at the gym doesnt affect anything anyway.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1lzbuge/parents_want_me_to_stop_using_colored_conditioner/,1

teenagers,2025-07-14 03:00:22,Did I do anything wrong by writing songs about my exes,"So for context, I 15M have dated a few people so far, I wont be including their names but instead using fake names. The names Im going to be using are Rose and Tulip. Now rose 15F and I stopped dating because her parents didnt want her in a relationship (but also not with me specifically) they had good reasons for not wanting her to be with me, I believe one of them is that they had seen all of our texts and I think another reason is that we were far too clingy on dates, but I digress. Now Tulip 14F left me after I made unhinged and fucked up comments about her that I will not be repeating her and I was also overall a bad partner, I also brought up the topic of s3lf harm around her and my friends rather casually, not knowing that she had struggled with it in the past. Another reason I believe she may have left is that I was too clingy and love bombed her. The reason Im writing this post is I had the idea of writing a pop punk album about love and breakups and I was going to feature details about the dates and breakups with these two in the album, I had already written lyrics for 3 rather specific songs regarding them that my close friends could look at and know its about that person. Now I was pretty proud of these songs so I sent the lyrics to my friends Jane 15F and Zach 15M (fake names) and they both said it was creepy and gross that I was writing these lyrics about these girls who both left me for good reason, saying its gross and creepy to write about your minor ex girlfriends who left you for good reasons they also said I should scrap the songs but I dont think I did anything wrong and neither do some of my other friends. This then led to a 20 minute argument where a lot of things were said but I later came to understand their points.

teenagers,2025-07-14 02:54:14,I need help adding more to this hot take,"CLAIM: men should wear bras I believe that men should have to wear bras because A.) men control the everyday fashion industry, including the manufacturing of bras (I know. Very ironic). Victorias Secret owns half the USs bra sales, and who do we have to thank? Their 82 year old male CEO. By making men wear bras, bras will become more -accessible -comfier -have better sizing (especially on the smaller end, since the majority of AMABS dont have large upper chest areas (in terms of cup size, not all around width) -overall better, and based more around accessibility, comfortability and practicality rather than looks and the appeal of men. - masculinity would be seen differently and would bridge more with femininity(making misogyny go down in some way, or just be seen differently) -sex appeal would go up(I KNOW THIS IS WEIRD, STAY WITH ME FOR THIS. Men without shirts would mean something more and be more attractive, since seeing mens chests wide out n open would be less normalized (making seeing mens chests shirtless a bigger deal). - bras would be less sexualized -chest support for men with bigger pecs - bra clips would be in the FRONT and not the back, making it easier to take off Overall, bras would be more comfortable for everyone if men were socialized to wear them, and gender expression would get treated differently If men created bras to lead to/based around their one goal: sexualization! Purely ment for women, designed and manufactured by men, why arent men themselves held to the same standards and expectations. If we change our ideas for when bras should and shouldnt be worn for EVERYONE, we can all collectively get our standards straight based around bras and their use. ALSO: the concept of what parts of tits, and when (also including men) is so inconsistent. With afabs youre allowed to show the fat but not the nip, but if you get rid of the fat (the part that differentiates afabs and amabs) (the part that you ARE allowed to show) all of a sudden you ARE allowed to show the nip. So which part is the problem the fat or nip. This only further proves the inconsistency. ALSO HOT TAKE: there are plenty of men out there that need to be humbled. Bras would be the perfect humbling solution.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1lzbdbr/i_need_help_adding_more_to_this_hot_take/,0

Im attractive, not too popular, and known for being a player and being with many girls (despite it being under 10). To put it simply, I have options. Despite having options, I noticed this girl a year older than me. Shes this somewhat quiet, beautiful girl, 1 year older than me. From what I know about her friends and what ive seen of her, shes smart (good classes), talented (ballet), modest (not always posting on social media/wearing revealing clothes), funny (always laughing), and kind (has a neurodivergent brother that I always see her helping.) She sounds like the perfect girl, right? Heres the problem, weve never talked. Whenever I see her in the halls, we share eye contact, but it feels so meaningful. Weve smiled at each other, grazed into eachother, and yet havent spoken. When we were at our schools graduation, she scanned the crowd when looking for her brother and her eyes stopped in mine for a moment longer. It may be nothing, but certainly feels like something. Heres the Christian part (feel free to disregard if it doesnt align with your faith). Im not a perfect guy. I keep falling back into the sin of masturbation and sexualizing women around me, yet i cant think of her in a lustful light, only in love (for lack of a better word). The other night, i broke my nofap streak and felt like a failure. Whenever this happens, I always feel scared that im worthless and i feel a cloud of evil around me, but this didnt happen that night. In fact, she was in my dream. I was walking down the stairs in school at the back of a crowd. She was walking up, at the front of a group of girls with another girl i know in her grade. Girl 2 said Hey thats that [my name] kid. First, the girl looked at the guy in front of me (who has a girlfriend, we used to be friends) and then looks over at me and smiles.

I don't like talking to people I don't know, and I look mad all the time. I had a crappy haircut at the time, so you couldn't even see my face. The teacher was talking about rules and whatnot, and I was thinking about whatever else I was planning on doing. I saw the teacher look and me, and for some reason I decided to glare back at him? Eventually, Mr teacher started picking on me more in class, and was nicer to me than I expected(And no, not in some creepy way) He even wrote a note for me on the bird house I made.

teenagers,2025-07-14 02:16:46,Im confused about my relationship with my guy best friend,"So we are both 16. I have been friends with him for 11 years now. I have also become close to his sister who is a year younger and we all frequently do things together. So I have always been allowed to sleepover their house since their parents trust me and also because of how long we have all been friends. Anyway, I went over last night and as usual we were all hanging out and stuff. Then, (again as usual) his sister fell asleep at around 11 while we were watching a movie. So we stayed up and talked about a bunch of random stuff. Even brought up the topic of crushes. We both asked if the other had any crushes, neither of us really gave a straight answer (like, oh well, you know, Im not really sure type answer). That was till 4:30am. We all sleep on their couch that is just set up like |__| (the lines each represent people). I was in the middle area and they were on either side. But basically him and I laid so that our heads were in the same direction (hopefully that makes sense). ANYWHO, since we were both getting tired we just sat on our phones, occasionally showing each other a funny video or so. Then, I fell asleep. He kept checking to see if I was awake and he said I finally just stopped responding and my phone fell out of my hands, playing a TikTok on loop. So he shut it off for me, and said he went to bed. (This is a similar cycle that repeats at all sleepovers and now it seems like he looks forward to it since he tries to put the movie on/ get his sister asleep asap). ALL OF THIS TO SAYdoes he maybe like me or are we just close friends and what should I do? Im not sure if I like him back or not but the more I think about it, the more Im not like, totally against it? Im phrasing it worse than I mean but Im looking for advice on if this behavior could mean he likes me and if so; A, what can I do to figure out if I like him, and B, should I confront him about my suspicions or leave it be?

teenagers,2025-07-14 02:11:53,Is this an unpopular opinion about beauty standards?,"Too many people want that classic slim girl with the tiny waist and full ass, or everyone wants some thick latina or goth girl which like I get it but its gotten to the point where people don't appreciate natural beauty anymore. I might be biased because I'm in a relationship but natural beauty is always way better than any sort of makeup. guys are gonna be all over a girl with 20 pounds of makeup or maybe they want some woman who's had plastic surgery or maybe their 10/10s all look THE EXACT SAME. some ""baddie"" on Instagram who photoshops her waist, and uses makeup/filters. it's plastic, it's unnatural, it's insecure. there's nothing attractive about being insecure about what people think of you. now here's the part about natural beauty that I want to get back to: why don't more people appreciate the mother build? it's hot af. it's fine if you like slim girls or maybe girls with an even distribution of meat on their bones (remember body fat can be attractive as long as you aren't obese or disproportionate) but y'all really gotta appreciate the mother build. I mean like that high waist, not fat but enough body fat to show a healthy physique, not unnaturally fixed or dieted when it's not necessary. more below the waist than around the chest, and a little muscle on the legs. ofc you need a natural face, no makeup or very minimal, just to show off your individuality. the women who have always stood out the most to me are the ones who look the most natural, particularly in the face, and I think that mens standards for beauty are misguided. this is also partly for women who get plastic surgery, that shit looks horrible I'm sorry. a nose job might be alright but getting your ass filled up like a balloon looks unnatural and just unattractive. stay healthy. don't stress your eating habits, don't ""fix your body"", just try to lead a healthy lifestyle and maintain yourself so you don't become schlubby or anorexic. and I'm not gonna rant about girls standards for how guys look but I will say you better not be taking height seriously as a standard honestly im sure most of you girls are fine but if you think you can't live without someone who's at least 6 feet tall you're vain and insecure and you should...do better. anyways if you read all that, thanks. idk where I should put this so I figured here might be interesting because it's so full of desperate teenagers. TLDR: guys, learn to accept girls' natural beauty (as long as they ain't screwing over their health) girls, learn to embrace your beauty without having to ""fix"" it and ftlog don't take height seriously when considering options for a partner, it's about character ffs Also I'm not hating on anyone. Thick, slim, motherly, any natural physique they're all great. not belittling anyone (but I'm encouraging you not to become overweight or abnormally skinny if you can help it). if I'm not hating, I expect no hate back. got a problem? there's always the down vote button.

teenagers,2025-07-14 02:00:55,Roommate and I are in a fight over living conditions when I'm sick,"So I decided to take this early college program and it's my first time dealing with a non family roommate. Consequently the two of us are very young(myself 17F, roommate 16M), and quite frankly immature. I'm in a fashion design program and he's in a comic program so we only see each other during the mornings and evenings. Yet when we're around each other from my perspective we're always disagreeing on something. So this last week I've been doing the chores around our dorm and I usually wake him up in the morning too bc he oversleeps a lot. And I really quite like small domestic tasks like sweeping and dishes and taking the trash out so that's not a problem for me. But at the same time he's very uncleanly and stays up one to two hours after our agreed bedtime (11pm) on a discord call with his friends. And Ik voice pitches and cracks aren't something he can control but the sheer volume is what's bothering me. When I talked about this with my friends they said to just tell him to keep it down and I've done that a couple times but I'm kinda unconfident around him and it doesn't do anything for the next night. Our rooms thermostat is also on his side of the room and I thought it was really cold and I even bought an extra blanket so I could sleep through the night. So up until now I haven't really communicated my frustrations and I feel like that's partly my fault. But this weekend I started to get really sick which I wasn't expecting at all. I had been around a couple of sick people while I was wearing a mask and my college program is in a city that isn't exactly known for its cleanliness. Regardless I got pretty sick and my roommate had bought a case of water bottles at the beginning of the week when we moved in. By the time he got sick he had polished off about 6. And even though we had a sink and the water out of the sink was fine I started drinking his water bottles and over the weekend I drank 8 or 9. This became our first argument as I had been drinking the water that he bought when I had a perfectly fine reusable water bottle. I don't think that should've been a problem and I haven't apologized for it and that's one of the reasons I'm making this post. Today there were two arguments. First of all I had stopped doing the chores once I got sick and that led to our counter and bathroom getting messy and the trash hadn't been taken out in four days. I hadn't really cared since I was in bed all day and I didn't need the counters but my roommate got upset. He started cleaning while complaining about how there was so much stuff to do and we kinda just threw insults at each other while he worked. Again neither of us are particularly mature. Eventually I fell back asleep and when I woke up my roommate was gone at some social activity hosted by the school. I was butt ass freezing and I was so annoyed and groggy after our argument and my sickness not getting better that I went on to his side of the room and checked the thermostat to turn it up. Now I am terrible with temperatures and thought he had set out room to like 68 F or something bc that's cold to me. And when I got a fever I was like ok I feel colder bc I have a fever. I go over to look at the thermostat and he had set it to 55 F!!!!! I immediately turned it up to 75 F which ik is 20 degrees higher but I was so infuriated. It felt so fucking good to actually have a temperate room and I wanted to turn it up to like 80 bc I still felt chilly but that would've been unreasonable. Anyway I go back to sleep bc between the fever, headache, and cough it was simply more enjoyable. Now when I wake up at around 6:30pm his standing in the middle of the room and tells me it feels way too hot(despite sleeping with a comforter every night of the week). At this point I just lose it bc I feel like shit and it's just too much for me. He says he should be allowed to compromise on a temperate between 55 and 75 and I just tell him no and if he does I'm getting our RA to settle things and we kinda just go back and forth on that for an hour. He says his boundaries are being pushed, I said my boundaries are being pushed and bc he doesn't want to get this settled by our room(floor? Idk) assistant were just at a stalemate. Reason I'm making this post is bc I've gotten pretty much everything I've wanted so far and yet I still feel like my boundaries are being ignored so I thought I'd get a second opinion. TLDR; I got sick, my roommate doesn't want to change his living accommodations to me being sick, and now we're fighting over who should have to put up with more stuff.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1lzab3k/roommate_and_i_are_in_a_fight_over_living/,1

teenagers,2025-07-14 01:01:17,I caught my son masturbating,"Initially, my plans that day included going out shopping with the rest of my family, except for my son, who would remain at home. However, I soon remembered that I didn't finish arguing with a stranger at the internet about the Roman Empire, so I stayed at home to think of what to say. About 30min immersed into my thoughts, I suddenly heard a loud aah noise coming from my son's bedroom. Scared of what could possibly have happened to him, I promptly proceeded to his room in order to assess the situation. The door was closed, but not locked, as it opened without resistance when I turned the doorknob. The moment the bedroom came into view, I was appalled, shocked and confused at what I saw. My son was standing butt naked in front of me, with one hand extended towards the door, presumably intending to lock it. He started trying to explain himself in the same instant, but soon gave up, given how easy it was to guess what he was doing. Thankfully, he will soon move out, since he is going to college, so I will have no need to pretend I didn't see what I saw; nevertheless, it is truly unfortunate that this has transpired. People, please lock your doors when you're going to do that, unless you want to traumatize another father.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1lz9339/i_caught_my_son_masturbating/,540

It really does feel like this stupid fear, just cripples my ability to do anything, other than overstimulating in order to stop thinking about it... and in general... I know what I should theoretically do, take it one step at a time, not think about the very distant future, but about for example the next few days, and start to plan them out.

My dad works a good job at the united nations and i don't want to give much detail but he makes good money. I'm not from the US. My brother is probably the smartest guy i know. He speaks 5 languages fluently (All of them really well). He is like smart asf and knows everything ever about history. He gets really good grades and is going to a good university. While as for me, i still get really good grades. My dad pays a lot for our education, a private school thats 10k a year for each of us and we've been going since kindergarten. I have what would be a 4.0 gpa in the US, and i can speak 4 languages fluently (mothertongue level basically) and one other language (spanish) i can understand basically everything but i cant speak it that well. I'm good at maths (we had exams this year, since we go to a french school, and i got a 100/100 on my maths exam and my teacher legit cried cus i was the first student of her career to ever get that score). But i also have other passions. I love the gym, I'm obsessed over the benchpress and getting a 100kg bench. And also really like cars and engines. I was thinking of studying mechanical engineering. But honestly, i don't want to live a life where i study for a bunch of years just to work a job that i dont like, sitting all day at my desk, that's gonna make me hate the stuff that i love. It's not for me. I'm not that kind of guy. I would rather be a mechanic and work on cars and maybe have my own car repair shop. Fuck my dad would kill me. I wanna take risks in life, i wanna do stuff that i like. I was thinking of buying a used engine off of ebay or fb marketplace and kinda toying with it and figuring out what every piece does on my own. I play a lot of car mechanic simulator 2021 so i know most car components. I also recently bought an arduino kit and i'm learning to program it so that i can make a pushup counter that tracks how many pushups i'm doing automatically. I don't want the 9-5 job life so that i can work all day, work my life away, to get paid like not even that much, so that i can barely see my kids and waste my life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1lz7p85/15m_i_just_want_to_live_life_my_own_way/,3

teenagers,2025-07-13 23:41:59,I think i have a crush on my best friends crush. What do i do?,"So this has been eating at me for the last couple of days and i didnt know where else to go so here i am. So, last month my best friend met this guy (i'll call him Noah) and she told him about me so he asked her if we could all hang out one day. She asked me and i liked the idea so we made plans. Leading up to the hangout he followed me on both tik tok and instagram and kept sending me videos and we found out we have a lot in common. we like some of the same shows and videogames that i dont know a lot of people who like so i immedietly got excited i can finally talk to someone about it. 3 days ago the three of us finaly went out and even though it was my first time meeting him i got comfortable really quick and we spent the whole time talking and goofing off. The more i started talking to him the more i started catching feelings for him. I dont usually catch feelings for people that quickly, it usually takes me a while before i can open up, but with him it was different. When we all went back home i couldnt stop thinking about him and overanalizing every interaction we had lol. That was until the next day. Me and my best friend made plans to go out for breakfast in the morning and while we were talking about Noah she casually told me that she has a little crush on him. I started pressing more about the details and she told me she felt this way for a few weeks now and that she felt there were signs he liked her back. She started talking about the reasons she felt he liked her back and it makes me think that he most likely likes her too. I just feel so devestated that theres a big chance he likes her back and guilty for feeling that way or even liking him in the first place. I feel like i should already start trying to get over him but im sick if doing that everytime i start actually liking someone.

teenagers,2025-07-13 23:28:13,"I don't want to celebrate my birthday, and my mother is angry about it","Ok, this may sound very normal for any teenager, but I HATE my birthdays. For as long as I can remember, I have hated my birthday. Every year, without fail, I hate the month of November. One shit or another has always happened to me. For example, on my eighth birthday I got the news that my pregnant cat had died, and on my last birthday my parents were arguing in front of my friends. Their discussions have reached the point where it makes me uncomfortable, I hate, to mention the topic of family relationships or the home environment. My father has always been somewhat strict, but nothing worrying. I know he wants me and my brothers to have the best, but he is used to being rough and dry; I don't blame him, he didn't have a father to teach him paternal affection. My mother, however, has always been more attached and trusting. Although I don't talk to her much, she always insists that I meet my family since I always spend it in my bedroom or avoid being at home. My fifteenth birthday is coming, and I don't know if it is celebrated in other parts of the world, but in my country, in Latin America, it is celebrated with a huge party and a massive number of guests. I don't want that. My circle of friends is reduced to a small group and a few others, but I am not a sociable person at all. My mother insists on celebrating it, because as a teenager she couldn't celebrate her own XV to take care of my uncles, because she's the older sister and all that shit. It already has a living room, cameraman, food, clothing, absolutely everything. But I don't want to. I don't know if it's some kind of social anxiety or panic, but I hate attending events, especially if I'm going to be important. But I also don't want my mother to feel bad, nor for my family to be disappointed in me because they all have the habit of getting extremely drunk at any celebration, and after my quince, it's going to be a long time before they get another excuse to get drunk. I already have a bad reputation in my family, and I don't know what to do to avoid looking bad.

teenagers,2025-07-13 23:15:13,A good start to a relationship?,"Help me understand if I am good at building my first relationship with a girl. At first we met in a sports mafia club. We talked a little, talked about our studies at uni and stuff. Later I helped her move to another dorm, then we started running into each other sometimes at parties and I always walked her home after that. Today after playing mafia she invited me to her place to build Lego and watch some movie in the background. We built Lego flowers and watched some anime. In general, we had fun, we talked about common topics, laughed at the stupidity of the plot in this anime and just had a good time. When we had already built the Lego, I realized that today was Sunday and there were no night buses, and I had to walk an hour to get home and I didn't want to. I had to call a taxi. While we were standing outside waiting on the taxi we talked about something else and then I decided to apologize for the fact that I am not very sociable and emotional (this is true). She says that everything is fine and that she is the same and does not like noisy companies and that she has to leave her comfort zone there. And that she is comfortable with me. I said that I like the way our relationship is built, she agreed. I hugged her. Then we talked about how this is our first relationship and how difficult it is to talk about it. Then my taxi arrived, she asked if she could kiss me on the cheek. She kissed me, we hugged and said goodbye. Now I am already home and writing this post. People who have had something similar in their relationships, tell me if everything is going well for us and if I need to do anything to improve something.

Things have gotten a bit better but lately I'm still feeling insecure. There's a friend (I think 16M) she said ""good night"" to in voice call in a very flirty manner and that threw me off, she admitted it wasn't appropriate and apologized but I still think about it every now and then. That friend came over to her house today and they just played some video games in the living room. She never wears a bra at home and wears transparent pajamas that usually reveal her underwear because of how transparent it is. I'm not sure if she wore those pajamas or something more appropriate like some actual clothing but in any case, she wasn't wearing a bra. Am I righteous for feeling insecure that my girlfriend is wearing possibly transparent clothing and no bra (her nipples are sometimes visible from certain angles which is why it matters) when her male friend that I feel insecure about is in her house.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1lz5e8j/i_15m_feel_insecure_about_my_relationship_with_my/,3

Were both theatre kids and met a few months ago while in a show together. Since then, weve become very close, texting often and sharing our personal issues. Weve also confided in each other about our love lives. Recently, we decided to have a hangout with some of our friends. At the time it wasnt really a big deal but as the day gets closer Ive been getting more excited and kind of nervous to see her. I just saw her yesterday and it felt different than other times Ive seen her. Every time she was near me I would smile and I just felt warm inside. (Kinda cheesy I know, sorry) I have even recently found myself attempting to do this big gesture for her thatll probably cost me quite a bit of money. (Sorry for the vagueness, Im just paranoid she might see this and put the pieces together if I add too many details). And obviously it goes without saying that I also find her very pretty. I just dont know if all of this is normal for someone I only see as a friend. I think Im starting to like her. Im worried I might be in the wrong for this though because our grades dont touch. Ill be a senior soon and shell be a sophomore soon. So is this a problem?

So I (16m) work at the same grocery store as this girl (16f) who I'm interested in. We are in the same grade but go to different schools so up until this summer, neither of us have known the other existed. I work at a checkout line right behind hers so we're near each other. Also this has both been our first week on the job. The first few days I noticed her glancing at me once or twice during her break but that's probably just her observing her surroundings. On the fourth day I figure I might as well try and talk to her. I ask her what school she goes to, she responds then I follow up asking her if she knows one of my friends that's at her school. She responds but then we're cut off by someone checking out in her line. Next day rolls around, I ask her her name, she says and asks mine. The day after that, she's walking from the bathroom, past my cash register and back to her register when I ask her if she does any sports at her school. She stops, answers my question then there is a short pause before she keeps walking back to hers. The thing is that she didn't try to keep the conversation moving or anything, like she could've asked what I did or something. It's not like she was rushing to get back to her register because once she got there she was just fidgeting with a pen. Just to add she doesn't seem to be shy because I hear her chatting sometimes with the people who come through the register.

Now there was space for my scooty to squeeze through out of it but the child was trying to open his car door to get out. i wasn't able to read the situation well so I gave them gesture to close ur door and so I squeezed out. the man (his father) in the car immediately started cursing me shit for what do reason like I didn't even touch his car but he really was in anger. As I parked somewhere else he got off his car and came right towards me cursing me crazy saying u fucking illiterate ""chutiya"" what if my child had got hurt cuz of u like dude first of all there was enough space for my scooty to go out and not even touch ur car or ur child's door. I quickly understood that this guy is just forcing a road rage tryna fight me. so I'm simply started apologizing cuz it was imp for me to get back to friends and have the dinner as we were already late. but this guy was really pushing himself and abusing me constantly trying to make a scene on road. People started gathering to see what was happening. I hence tried to de escalate the situation and not try to fight him. even his wife was saying it's ok he said sorry but this guy was fucking tryna remove his day's frustration on me. he even said that ""what if I break ur teeth and say sorry ""In front of my friends. i apologised a few times more untill he left finally cursing me more in front of his 8 year old. My friends asked me instantly what happend and are u alright and it's ok dw bout it. but that guy completely fucked my mood. we finally ate some food had fun at a friend's house. i finally forgot bout this but it still sometimes feel like maybe i should've gave that guy a tase of his own medicine one maybe show him that actions have consequences buddy.

You telling me the same thing everyone else in my life has been telling me since I was 13 is not going to miraculously make me decide to change my mind.* Back on topic!! My entire life I've never wanted to have kids, and finally, I've got confirmation that I can donate my ovaries to someone who will actually want to use them!! I'm so happy, I will actually get to meet the person as well through the organization. Growing up, my aunt wasn't able to have kids. She had 6 miscarriages before finally having her baby; I am so happy that with my contribution I'm actually able to give a mother the ability to have kids so she doesn't have to go through what my aunt did. Originally, I was just going to go to another country to have it done (because doctors in America think they own your body) but because it's a donation it gets covered and I can help someone fulfill their dream while fulfilling mine!!

teenagers,2025-07-13 20:40:26,Day 117 of sharing a Bible verse!,"Hi folks, tonight's verse is: Yahweh God made a woman from the rib which he had taken from the man, and brought her to the man. The man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called woman, because she was taken out of Man. Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother, and will join with his wife, and they will be one flesh. Genesis 2:22-24 - WEB The Lord God then formed a woman out of the rib that he had taken from the man. He brought her before the man. The man said, This one is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. She shall be called woman because she was taken from man. This is why a man leaves his father and his mother and joins with a wife, and the two become one flesh. Genesis 2:22-24 - NCB Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. The man said, This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, for she was taken out of man. That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh. Genesis 2:22-24 - NIV We all know how the story goes. But have you ever wondered why Eve was born out of a rib? Both the Bible and some scholars give us an answer: the woman was created from a rib so she would be *equal* to man. She wasn't taken from his head, nor from his feet. She isn't man's possession, she's the one the man shall always protect, just as God created and protected the man. The woman, in the Bible, was yes depicted as inferior to man, but Christ came to revert this: He not only healed a woman as His first miracle, but He also revealed His resurrection first to a woman (which so happened fo be the same woman). Jesus was never rude to women for who they were. And neither should you. Women are gifts: traeat them as you'd treat yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1lz39o1/day_117_of_sharing_a_bible_verse/,4

teenagers,2025-07-13 20:18:56,"I got over my fear, and texted my EX","For context: She was my bestfriend, she was going thru some unfortunate events in life, and I was there to console her. She then proposed to me, and I chickened out of saying no (cuz she was crying before, and I didn't want her to cry again, or hurt her in any way) so I said yes. I didn't think much abt it, thought I'll be as boring as possible, but 1 week in, and finally, I started enjoying my time with her, I finally developed feelings for her. The downfall: I started messaging her every hour, I'd call her every hour, basically I was chasing her. And once when she was sleeping, I called her when she told me not to, and, her mom saw it. ""Pasandida mard"", who is this guy? Because her parents found out, we had to take a break, I went insane, although I wasn't supposed to text or call her, I didn't. But whenever I got my chance, I'll take it, so her friend blocked me. Redemption: After I realised what happened, I became depressed, unable to accept the truth. I would sleep late, skip gym, study less, classic degeneracy. But then I had an appendix removal. I woke up. I realised I was doing it all wrong. She loved me, I got addicted to her. So I started studying how this works. Aftermath: 3 months had passed, since I last talked to her, she later unblocked me herself, after she got her phone back. But we still didn't talk, my shame was stopping me from trying. But today, I posted my progress in the gym, I don't upload much, but yea. She liked my story, which gave me courage to talk to her.(As shown in the above picture)(Also, a part of it is translated)",https://i.redd.it/k1qeculp9pcf1.png,4

This is gonna be a somewhat major change in how I see myself I guess, since I cant say Im a kid anymore. That kind of sucks I guess. Idk what you guys talk about since Ive barely even lurked here in my 7 years of using Reddit, but if I were to give yall advice: dont waste your teen years. They might be one of the most important times of your life, so find good friends. 1 close friend is always better than 10 shallow friends. Get some hobbies and stick to them. You never know, they might even be useful someday. Stay in school and maybe go to college, or if not that, at least a community college or even a trade school. Drugs might be fun but theyre not worth it, especially at your age. If youre struggling mentally, find a therapist and be open with them. I made a lot of mistakes during my teen years, and I hope no one wastes it doing nothing and not properly dealing with my mental issues like I did. Anyway, thank you for reading (if anyone even cares lol) and use your teen years wisely and enjoy them while I achieve unc status.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1lz1vim/well_today_is_my_last_day_as_a_teenager/,31

I have no family that loves me because they think Im weird and off putting. I have no friends for the exact same reason. My neighbors dont even like me, bc i would stay inside all of the time and ignore them bc I was afraid I was a danger to everyone around me when I was younger and believed the thoughts well into my 20s. I have no internships or career specific jobs under my belt. I never went to career fairs out of embarrassment. I withdrew from my university out of spite and waited last minute to enroll in summer classes bc I didnt know I was still enrolled. Im still a sophomore. I got depressed about my decisions so badly I didnt have the willpower to get a job this summer. I scream cried to my parents about my decision instead of just telling them I had made a mistake. Im enrolled in another university thats way harder and bigger and socially more hard to get my way in. I have the mind of a 14 year old. Most of my life I spent my life worried about disappointing people but I ended up putting that into fruition. Idk what to do with myself, I dont think I can handle adult responsibilities. Everyones calling me stupid and useless, my siblings are older and successful and Ive always been compared to them. I guess everyone was right about me.

That second chance never came, but we stayed friends and I accepted it. Skip a few weeks and I meet another girl (A). We click almost instantly, but she doesnt like that I still talk with B. I told her were just friends and that I could try to cut contacts with her. Spoiler: I did not and basically lied to A about it. A eventually finds out, gets mad af (rightfully so) and we break up the next day. A told me she cant trust me anymore at this point and doubts anything I ever did during our relationship, mentioning that I only took advantage of her.

youngadults,2025-07-11 13:22:32,Why is there a stigma against minimum wage jobs?,"This is a question that I've had for a long time. I've worked a few minimum wage jobs. I currently have a part-time job while taking classes at a community college. (Not gonna say where I work due to personal reasons) I don't love my job, but it's teaching me how the real world works. People who work in food service or retail are often stereotyped as teenagers who are working a mindless job with no marketable skills. My parents have always told me that I need to go to college or I'll end up like the guy who's 60 and still works at Walmart. I mean, there are some parents who force their kids to get jobs or they'll cut them off from supporting them. Even then, not everybody can go to Harvard and become a doctor, lawyer, or engineer. But if you have a college degree in underwater basket weaving, then good luck getting a high-paying career, as you might as well work at McDonald's and put the fries in the bag for the rest of your life. Boo-hoo, it sucks to be you. What I'm saying is that jobs that pay minimum wage don't lack skill. As many of them involve cooking, cleaning, taking out the trash, and helping customers with whatever they need. Not only that but they benefit the community as well wether you. As we wouldn't really have a society of nobody worked. Especially in this economy, it's cruel that people who work hard deserve to be poor. As with $15.00 an hour (which is the minimum wage in Arizona where I live), you can't really afford a car to drive, a house or apartment to live in, or a vacation to go on. People's wages haven't kept up with inflation, and all of this reflects that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1lx6s7y/why_is_there_a_stigma_against_minimum_wage_jobs/,9

Hes deffo older, lied about being closer to my age but theres no way in hell. All in all hes nice and funny, weve shared a lot of intimate details and fantasies like we were basically each others sex phone lines. I stopped talking to him awhile ago cause I wasnt feeling it, but recently I got the urge to talk to him again. Thing is, I started thinking why do I seek comfort in a complete online stranger? My friends would definitely not do something like this. Thats why Im asking the bunch of you what you think about the situation lmao. I have a healthy social life, go out almost every weekend, go on dates and my self esteem isnt low. I have to admit, my love life has been draining me lately, like I get put off by people quickly. Maybe thats the reason, but I feel like a 2000s movie teenager belonging to the reject clique, and not in the fun/quirky Damian and Janet way from Mean Girls. Kinda ashamed for messaging him?

I just don't want to though, I don't want to hookup with people I don't know, I honestly don't even know how because I'm just not like that socially, I don't like being drunk or drinking, I hate the taste of alcohol and over reliance on it runs in my family so I don't want to start, and parties just overwhelm me. Still, it makes me feel like kind of a loser when everybody else is doing it. I don't really want to talk about it to my friends either since they'd probably stop inviting me out and talking to me as much since we'd just have less to do/talk about, and I don't really have any ways to make other friends. I also don't have a partner and even people I know who are less interested in partying have become kind of obsessed with dating or finding a partner or hanging out with theirs.

Likeseriously? She doesn't even listen to me in the first place. Then they try to sweet talk me to get things done around the house and God forbid I refuse. It's a whole different story. And its not like my sister ever shows me any empathy. In fact, she joins in when mother dearest is throwing insulting or passive-aggressive remarks. Its like tag-teaming me just makes their day.

youngadults,2025-07-06 02:28:56,How to deal with parents who still treat me like a high schooler?,"Sometimes I feel like my parents, mostly my mother, still treat me like a high schooler. Im going into my second year of college right now. F21-18. Im trying to find any kind of job so I can eventually save up money to move out with a friend but Im not having much luck on the job search front. For a while things were fine between me and my parents, but I think its mostly because I started to shut down more when at home. One of the biggest things that make me feel like they treat me like a high schooler still is that recently my mother started telling me I cant have my friends in my room? Which I thought was odd. I understand being concerned about stuff but I dont smoke or drink at all. Last time I had them over was to help me film something for my college class. Theyve known my friends for a few years so they know were not a bad group. I also thought it was really weird that they didnt want my friends to be in my room because its my room. I even moved them from the living room to my room when my father came home once to give him the living room to watch tv and have some privacy for himself after work. Plus I dont want my parents pestering them with questions about their personal lives. My room is my space and the rest of the house is theirs. I dont even leave my own stuff lying around the house like my younger brother does all the time. Im very neat and tidy. I dont disrespect them like my brother does. Hes even gotten blackout drunk with his sports team once (hes in early years of high school) and my parents didnt do a lot to reprimand him or talk to him about responsibility. And Im actively trying to pursue my education and get a job. Its not like I stay out crazy late either or go out all the time without telling them. Idk it just feels odd to me, especially because theyve never told me that before with other times I had them over or in my room. Maybe its because Ive started to invite my partner over, since Id like for them to get to know my parents and have a nicer relationship with them (not that it would determine anything but it would be nice lmao). And god knows I wouldnt do crazy shit in my parents house of that sort iykwim. Theres many other things theyve said to me now that Im older that I feel like people only really say to high schoolers or even younger kids. Like dont send scandalous pictures or get up to any funky business or drugs. Theyve never told me stuff like this when I was younger and I never really did stuff like that when I was younger anyway. It just makes me feel like theyre trying to cling onto something maybe in how they treat me since they didnt really do so when I was younger. Idk. The fact Im older now, I should get some more privacy. Ive already considered trying to move into either one of my grandparents houses but those come with their own problems itself. So how do I deal with my parents when they can treat me like a high schooler sometimes? Maybe the solution is to just stay out of the house as much as I can.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1lsqitw/how_to_deal_with_parents_who_still_treat_me_like/,5

It was over the course of a year or two they would hangout, and sleep together. It was never serious or exclusive, however his best friend is now dating her. Seeing as we are going to be hanging out with them a lot since they are best friends I am uncomfortable with being friends with her, talking to her, or honestly being in the same room as her. I dont want to cause a rift between them at all however I am not comfortable being friends with someone who knows my boyfriend in that way. Am I valid or just being jealous? Would you feel the same way? How do I explain my feelings to him without making him feel like I dont want him to ever see his best friend? EDIT: I do not currently or ever plan on hating this woman, or being mean to this woman. This is simply something that rubs me the wrong way. Also after talking with my bf he shared that his friend is also uncomfortable at the thought of bringing her around when I am around so it is not just me, nor just a woman thing, nor something that I am only feeling because I am young.

A place where I can breathe and grow.

So Im wondering: Has anyone here made a big solo move like this in your early 20s? What helped you feel grounded when you got there? How did you deal with loneliness or fear of the unknown?

I was 18 when we got together, and he was 28. I know theres a significant age gap, but it never bothered me because my parents have a 20-year age difference, so I thought it wasnt a problem at all! Since he came into my life, everything has changed. He treated me like a princess, and I reciprocated that. He was my knight in shining armor, my prince charming. There was a time when he surprised me by buying a home for us so we could live together, and we were so happy. However, he suddenly changed. I don't want to get into the specifics of the challenges we faced, but I never felt like a burden to him; he was the one with the problems. For two years, I never caused him any trouble. The first time I discovered he was cheating on me was with his ex-girlfriend, right before our first anniversary. I forgave him because, after all, he told me that he wont do that again. The second time, he lied to me about having to go to their main office in the city for a week due to some problems at work, but instead, he was with her, who was mourning her mother who died that time, and hes the one who comforted her (like ). When I found out, I erupted with anger; it felt like a volcano inside me. But he came back, and stupidly, I forgave him again. Now Ive just found out that the home he bought, which I thought was for us, was actually for them. Theyre the same age. He lied to me the whole time, and now Im questioning whether all the love he gave me was genuine. I feel like a fool. Maybe I really am a fool. Im crying right now. Now im so pressured to have my own house because of them. I felt like im left behind in all aspects. Its so sad to be a 20 year old, whos too young to rush things, but also too old not to.

But after a few days of fun scrolling, I stumbled upon a post where one of the 'teens' told a guy to join an adult group instead because he was 20 and not a teen anymore. It was shocking (or rather disheartening) I still can't accept the fact I have left teenage. Maybe because I am slightly skinny and short. Also, my college 2nd year is going but I'm pretty sure I look like a high schooler. I feel I haven't lived my teenage fully and some of the blame goes to COVID too. Or maybe it wouldn't have been much different even if COVID wasn't there cause I am anyways an introvert. I don't want to vent about it but just want to know if the feeling's mutual?",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1lmhtwu/still_feeling_like_a_teen/,16
youngadults,2025-06-28 08:06:17,"My mom still thinks Im on drugs, even though Ive been clean. I dont know what to do anymore.","For the past three years, my mom has been convinced Im on drugs. And I get why she started thinking thatbecause she did catch me once. I had a friend over, and I was either drunk or crossed (I honestly dont even remember which), but I came upstairs clearly out of it, and she saw me like that for the first time. That was the day everything changed. Before that, yeahI had been high around her a few times. I wont lie. Never really drunk, maybe once. But once she caught me that first time, its like everything after that became proof in her eyes. Now, it doesnt matter how I act, what I say, or what I doif I even*look*tired or off, she assumes Im using again. But the worst part is: Ive been clean. Especially this past year. I dont drink. I dont smoke. I dont use anything when Im home. I go to work, I go to the gym, and I come back. I dont hang out with friends anymore. Ive completely changed my habits to prove to her that Im serious about staying clean and earning her trust back. Even today*today*I did everything right. I got off work, went to pick up my paycheck, cashed it, and gave her $800 toward my car insurance. For years, I havent been able to pay it myself, and shes always had to cover me. This was the first time in a long time I could finally give back. She was happy. The vibes were peaceful. I even took her car to get an oil change, then went to wash her comforter at the laundromat. After that, I planned to get a haircut and hit the gym since weve got an important church event on Sunday, and I wanted to look nice. But before I even left the house, just as I was about to head to the gym, she looked at meand boom. Just like that, the day was over. She said I looked off, said I didnt respect her, said I was on drugs. Its like none of the good things I did even mattered. Like someone couldve just taken my face and messed it up in a way only she sees, and that alone is enough for her to decide Im using again. Thats what kills me. Ive been doing*everything*to show her Ive changed. I dont even hang out with my friends anymore. I dont go to the mall, I dont go out to eat, I dont even go ball. All I do is stay in the living room where she can see me or hop on Call of Duty with my boys. Thats it. The only places I go are the gym and work. I go to church every Sunday with her and my little brother. But this summer, I made the choice to do more than just attendIm trying to grow closer to God, read my Bible more, and really make a change. Not because anyone told me to, but because I want to live better. I want to be better. Still, none of it matters to her. Ive offered drug tests. Breathalyzers. Ive even told her Id call the police on myself. But she refuses every time. Says she doesnt need any tests. Says she can see it in my face. But that makes no sense. People dont look exactly the same every day. Even the cops cant arrest someone without testing them first. But my own mother acts like her judgment alone is all the proof she needs. Sometimes, Im literally scared to look tired around her. There have been days where I was just*exhausted*nothing elseand she swore I was high. It makes me feel trapped. Like Im living in a house where peace can be taken away in one glance. And whats really breaking me down is how hopeless it all feels. Like Im stuck in a loop. Things will be peaceful for a couple days, even weeksbut then out of nowhere, boom. All it takes is a glance, and suddenly Im a disappointment again. It doesnt matter how clean I am. It doesnt matter how hard I try. She just cant seem to see me as anything other than who I*used*to be. Today, after all thatafter a good day where I did everything rightI swear I almost walked down to the smoke shop five minutes from my house and bought a joint. Just to say screw it. Because it feels like no matter what I do, shes always going to accuse me anyway. But I didnt. I didnt because I dont want to lose. I dont want to go backwards. I dont want to give her a reason to be right. I want to stay clean. I want to live right. Im trying to respect her. Im trying to prove to her that Ive grown. But how do you stop doing something youve*already stopped*? What else can I do? Even when I go back to school, it doesnt end. I come home every weekend or every couple weeks, and now every time Im at school, Im just counting down the days with anxiety. I know Ill have to come home, stand in front of her again, and have her tell me Im on drugs. And its*so*draining. It eats at me. She says she doesnt want to talk to her friends about it, but honestlyI think she should. I*hope*theyd tell her to test me. I*pray*theyd tell her to drug test me. Because I swear, thats the only way I think Ill ever be able to clear my name. There are drug tests that check for*everything*weed, pills, hard drugs*everything.*But she wont do it. She just acts like she already knows whats true. And she talks about me like Im some addict. Like I cant help myself. Like Im destroying my life in secret. But let me be honest with yall: the only things Ive*ever*done are weed and alcohol. Maybe I took shrooms once or twice with the boys back in my freshman year of college. Thats it. No pills. No coke. No lean. Ive never touched a needle. Ive never smoked a cigarette. Nothing. Just weed, edibles, and drinking back when I was in that space. But now? Ive been done. And whats worse is the arguments. When she accuses me, it doesnt just stop after one conversationit turns into this back-and-forth that can last for*days.*Sometimes even an entire week. Ill plead with her. Ill explain everything. Ill tell her Im not on anything, that I*genuinely*am not. But she just doesnt believe me. Well argue. Shell say I look duped or off"" or even just ""drunk"". Then, eventuallyout of nowhereitll just stop, like she'll give me a lonnnng talk as i sit there and just listen for almost half an hour. Shell calm down. Or I guess, shell finally decide to believe me again. Shell say things like, Dont take drugs, or Be a good boy. And then, out of nowhere, shell even thank me. Shell say, Thank you for being a good boy and listening to me. And the*very next day or a couple days later*, shell look at me and assume Im on drugs again. Its emotional whiplash. And Im tired. Im trying so hard, but I dont know what else to do. If anyones been through something like this, pleasewhat do I do? How do you prove yourself to someone who refuses to believe youve changed?",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1lmhia3/my_mom_still_thinks_im_on_drugs_even_though_ive/,2

youngadults,2025-06-26 22:41:50,Exploding Internally,"I'm 25 and still live with my parents. I'm mixed, part black, part French, part Euro, part a bunch of things, etc, anyways. The older I get, the more I butt heads with them when it comes to the way I operate vs they operate, values, and viewpoints. I grew up very sheltered and protected, always supported, taken care of, never had to worry about a meal, a place to stay, or clothes to wear. I'm an artist. At heart. I find joy in photography, video making, video editing, drawing, painting, acting, interior design, graphic design, fashion, all of it. I just started an LLC in fact but its very in beginning stages and I don't really know what I'm doing. Anyways, every since I graduated from college with my BA in 2022, I have never been able to find a proper full time job or ANYTHING in my field. The economy absolutely sucks and on top of that I live in California. I live in an area with so much incredible opportunity so I'm like there should be so much for me. But I'm stuck. And working two jobs. One in food and another at a family-owned cafe. Schedule is always inconsistent and let me not forget to mention that it's important to know I have ADHD. So, I'm consistently forgetful, all over the place, feeling restless and disorganized, and pulled to a thousand things at once. I'm told to have trust in myself and do my own thing since I'm an adult but whenever I try to act like that then I'm caught under frustration of not putting the family first. I'm literally drowning in all these responsibilies, lack of social life, stability, and I can't even just function as an individual. I've got no space. I have no close friends, and I struggle to find the proper time, mental space and money to go to places CONSISTENTLY to actually meet people and form real and meaningful relationships. So I just feel so incredibly isolate in my experience. As someone with adhd, dopamine is in low quantities for me so I'm always looking to get out the house, go do something, get some thrill, have some activity, joy and excitement, feel inspired with my artistic soul. But i'm stuck at home all the time, between one job and the other, with both parents, a little brother, and two pets where one is a rescue so shes super skiddish and anxious by NATURE, is exTREEEEMLY needy and clingy, barks at EVERYTHING, and just annoys me when i look at her. i do love my cat though. but anyways. I need a community where I just feel like myself where I have some breathing room, where I can be creative, and do what I love. One of my main goals is to release multiple music albums and produce my own music. but i feel so damn far from all of this where i am. I grew up in predominately white and asian environments, even specifically at schools, and i never felt like i fit in anywhere. not black enough and not anything else. Inevitably my main attraction is towards white and asian guys, and you can see how successful that would go. I've never dated anyone and that's another insecurity in itself. A daily struggle. I feel so freaking lonely but also guilty for feeling lonely like its my fault and i'm too sensitive and not grateful enough. So that's been a big part of my identity and me struggling all my life to feel wanted, pretty, good enough, or attractive. I don't fit those beauty standards. Not to mention my neurodivergence (Depression, Anxiety, ADHD, and even mild tourettes). And I'm always trying to operate in a goddamn world who makes no room for this shiz and making me feel inside like I have to continue to feel guilt and shame about who I am and apologize for not being good enough for anything or anyone else. I've always been an empath and been very sensitive inside, but due to negative reactions as I grew up I figured that If i dressed more like a guy and acted more nonchalant then I'd at least be ""one of the boys,"" and seen as cool instead of a weak, sensitive, dumb little girl. my adhd also makes my brain process things differently so a lot of times people think I'm being sarcastic when I say I don't understand something or seem to ask questions with obvious answers. And so i automatically feel like I'm stupid all the time. So I grew up a forced and internalized tomboy who never felt feminine wiht a rectangular bulky body and so the vast majority of my wardrobe growing up were big oversized clothes. Now that I'm older I really want clothes to fit my body where I feel in my feminine energy and actually feel pretty. Let alone me being told by my uncle and others that ""my body isn't always gonna be this way"" and ""i'm not getting any older and looks fade, and I should show off my gorgeous body"" while im young or if i wanna attract a guy becaue ""that's how guys work."" and i should stop saying I want to attract a guy if i refuse to dress more ""provocatively"" and I should just suck it up and deal with it. I've always been afraid that if i dress like that then guys won't like me for me. so that's also been a big struggle. I grew up straightening my hair and hating my curly hair because i felt like i fit in more and was only prettiest with it straight. So part of the reason why I want more ""feminine"" clothes I know probably isn't the healthiest reason, to be seen as more attractive when it comes to convention, but I also know its not my fault that I feel that way. Anyways I don't even have the money to buy clothes to express myself the way that I actually want to, and that is a big lowerer of my self esteem all the time too. i just feel like a bummy rectangular thing. not a cute female. my dad used to tell me in certain oversized clothes that i looked ""bummy,"" and my mom said I look ""homeless."" Anyways man I just want my own place where I can be myself and try to repair my relationship with myself and try to be okay with the fact that I can be how I am and it be okay. I wanna believe I'm not making excuses and I actually AM enough. but its hard when these beliefs from experiences are so engrained for so many damn years inside my heart, neurons and body it just feels like I'm being in denial of obvious reality. People tell me i ""just need to be confident,"" but do you understand what a blanket statement that is? it's like saying i'm choosing to not be. I know that reality is only what i see through my beliefs. but man its hard dude. how am i the standard? when i've been shown for so long to not trust myself and not trust my standard. I just need to be free i have so much damn trauma. and my dad is like telling me him and my mom have to walk on eggshells around me when ""correcting"" me about anything because i'll spiral and start thinking I'm a horrible person. i hear that i guess it's called ""rejection sensitivity."" so now i feel guilty and stupid that I do that. but i can't control that I do that and that i've had sh\*tty experiences growing up. Being bullied. a white kindergartner girl being afraid to go down the slide with me becaue of my skin color. being told ""if you dont do this i'm not your friend anymore,"" and just many other microagressions that i KNOW even if i didn't understand there's no DOUBT they negatively affected me. Can someone help dude. I just need some empathy, understanding, and advice. Because this is literally so fxxking miserable and i just feel like my existence and essence of being as a whole is incorrect, and i'm just a hassle to the world. I feel like I self-sabatoge or whatever a lot too, because deep down I don't feel like I deserve for my needs to be met or for me to actually be happy. I always feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. i feel like I'm dumb, inconsiderate, clumsy by nature and yelled at for it, and am not working hard enough or trying hard enough.

I opted for a lesser-known uni with higher levels of employability focus, support, and interdisciplinary approach, to develop a wide set of skills that I believe isn't gonna be replaced by AI that quick. I would also like to spare more time for my personal entreprenuerial projects. However, my decision was looked down upon, and my friends think I'm less ""smart"" because I didn't go to Cambridge. My dad also told me I'm ""wasting"" my intellect, but tbh it isn't a waste, because for me, career stability outweights prestige by a large margin. So, with all the looks and comments from people I care about, I started to doubt my decision and feel a bit insecure. I personally believe that ""success"" is defined by yourself, and people shouldn't encourage or force me to chase the conventional definition of success unless I want to. My dad is now pushing me to ""achieve some achievements"" since I did not go to a prestigious university, so whenever I showed him a drawing, he was like ""Why didn't you enter this in a competition? No one could recognize how talented you are!"" And slowly, I started losing joy in learning, failing, and even began doubting myself. What do you think?

This is the typical ""not alone but lonely"" situation. And I don't even think my friends notice it. I have talked to my parents, but they think that means I inherently have problems and criticized me instead of comforting me. For my situation, there's a few distinctions between me and other ppl. For instance, most people follow societal values without questioning, while I normally make my own decisions to a greater degree and am not afraid to go against the norm if that's what's best for me. Most people tend to prefer misplaced loyalty over righteousness, while I prefer the latter. Take an example. The current job market is kind of bad right now, so I wanted to go to a university with better career support/employability focus instead of prestige. Many ppl from prestigious universities fail to find jobs anyway. However, my decision was met with snide belittlement and weird looks once people know I did not study at the best unis. My mum straight up said that my career prospects are terrible and looked down on me. Yet, I managed to get great internships and am happy with my life. I also never get the fact that nice people won't stand up for people being ridiculed/bullied for social standing/harmony, and they even befriend the bullies. For me, I would rather have no friends than tolerate injustice, but apparently to others it's different.

Its actually fucking unfair, because when she told me she wasnt ready for a relationship, I was patient and never got pushy. Yet, shes here practically forcing me to do things Im not comfortable with. She said that Im the man, I should be the one asking her to have sex, I should always be the one with the initiative and blah blah blah.

youngadults,2025-06-15 15:17:53,"Strating college, really scared. How do I navigate this huge change in my life?","I'm a 17 year old, soon 18, I'm finishing high school in Paris and signed up for college over in Rouen (2h away from Paris), set to start in September. I found a nice apartment (co-living, off campus, 5 people) situated pretty nicely between 2 campuses I'll be alternating between. My parents will be sharing the rent (pretty affordable, 490 a month). I'll be working this summer so I'll have a good amount of money by the time I start. I'm pretty well set. Though, to be honest, I'm freaking out. I'm a pretty sensitive person and change tends to affect me drastically. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and gone through a lot of therapy and medication. I feel better now, but I'm scared I might not feel so good once I get out of my comfort zone and have to adapt to a new way of life. Here are the things I'm mostly worried about: - Social life: I've lived in Paris for 10 years and it took me a long time to build a good social circle, with people I care about deeply and help me feel ""at home"" in a city across the ocean from where I was born and brought up (Utah/AZ). I'm pretty bad at starting friendships and I'm scared I won't fit in. Loneliness is a feeling I despise. - Responsibilities: as a kid, I've always been very dependent on my parents, I wasn't taught how to ""adult"" (manage my own groceries, funds, administrative decisions, transportation, medical appointments...), and in the blink of an eye I'll suddenly be left to deal with all this stuff by myself. I don't know how I'll do it, because I already get pretty overwhelmed just thinking about schoolwork. - My relationship: I've been with my boyfriend for almost 8 months and I love him so much. I don't know how this distance will affect us and I'm really scared that this will be a constant source of anxiety throughout my college years. I don't want to leave him, but I also don't want our relationship to deteriorate to the point of leaving him while I'm abroad. We'll try traveling to see eachother on some weekends and during vacation, but I don't know if that plan will work out in practice given all of the stuff we both will have to deal with in regards to our life projects. - Schoolwork: I have a bad tendency of letting my lack of motivation affect my presence in school, as well as my homework. Throughout high school I've usually chosen to skip classes when feeling too stressed or depressed, because I'd rather ""escape"" discomfort instead of facing it head on. My mom has usually had to force me out of bed for me to make it to school on time, if it wasn't for her I probably would've skipped a lot more classes. I'm scared I won't have the willpower to do important things that I don't ""feel"" like doing even though I HAVE to if I want to succeed in the future. - Regular work: I will have some money from my summer job, but eventually that money will run out and I'll need a more long term source of income to make sure I can live comfortably. I managed to get this summer job because I had family vouching for me at a place that they work at, and a lot of assistance through all the administrative steps leading to signing my contract. I won't know anybody in Rouen, I have no idea how to get a recruiter's attention, and I have no idea how I'll be able to fit a part time job with my school schedule. What can I do to alleviate all the anxiety I feel towards becoming an adult and leaving to start a new chapter of my life? What are some tips you guys have to help me navigate through all these things? What were your experiences starting college and leaving your old life behind? Thank you in advance to anyone who'll take the time to read this and try to help me out :)) (TL;DR): on the path to becoming an adult and studying abroad, scared of starting a new chapter and taking on new responsibilities.

My sensory sensitivities meant fluorescent lights hummed painfully, and my uniform itched. My stimmingrocking, hand-pressingwas my only relief, but it just invited more pointing. ""What's wrong with him?"" they'd ask. Isolation made me an easy target. I tried to connect through my intense interests, but conversations fizzled. Alone, I was vulnerable.

To make a long story short, I get worried about not being able to fit in with my college friend groups due to me not having any relatively unique features. I know that sounds weird, but just hear me out. Most of my friends are quirky. Mostif not allof them are part of the Alphabet mafia(LGBTQ+) and are more involved with the quirky, teenage autistic stuff, like losing their minds over random anime characters, drinking boba tea, spending crazy amounts of money on random video games, covering their backpacks with shiny stuff, etc. And then theres me. Im a straight dude with little to no interesting features, nothing that really makes me stand out except hes good with writing stuff and crap like that. Not to mention, I see a lot of joking about mental illnesses and stuff, like me when depression lol or I cant wait to ultrakill myself and then Im just likedude, wtf. I understand that Im a lot better off than most people due to my family and upbringing, and I really dont want to come off as some kind of bougie, Im better than you cuz my daddys rich kind of person, but I wont deny that Im in a better situation than a lot of other people, which makes me feel like due to this, I lack the ability to connect with others due to simply not understanding what they go through. So, yeah, thats what Im here about. I often feel distant from the other people in my friend group(or just other people in general) because rather than being cool and quirky and laughing at my own depression, I feel like this boring, bland, default-settings weirdo who doesnt understand what others have gone through because I came from a well-off, functional family and never felt any kind of sense of change in my life. And because of that, I feel like that shunts my ability to really connect with others. Is this a weird thing to feel? Does anyone understand what Im saying, and can anyone help me figure out what to do with these feelings? Thanks in advance.

I live in a small town an hour away from where I went to high school and where I started college (Ill explain) so Im far away from any of my friends. I had to drop out of high school half way through senior year because the principal was verbally and mentally abusive to me. She put me in online math classes with no teacher or any way to learn for all 4 years. It was ALEKS if anyone is familiar with- its great for review but when you dont know what youre doing AND you have a math disability its terrible. Junior year I tried to change schools into the public school I was zoned for in my small town and she refused to give me my own documents to switch and told me I was too stupid and that I would get robbed because it was a majority black school (it literally isnt but whatever). When it was time to apply for colleges she refused to let me access my GPA, grades or any other documents for admission. The college counselor was no help because he was new - so I wasnt able to apply anywhere. She really made high school hell for me and my parents didnt believe any of it until I asked to get my GED. I got within a month of dropping out - Im a smart kid so it wasnt hard. I had all As other than math and science - I was scoring within the top 10 in my state for the national french exam EVERY YEAR - Ive won awards for writing!! Im not stupid!! I was just mistreated!! That was spring 2024. That fall I went to a tech school an hour away to get my core so then I could transfer to the college I wanted to go to. 2 weeks in I ended up in the hospital for a ruptured ovarian cyst and for the next 9 months I was in the worst pain of my life. So I had to leave college for health reasons. I couldnt leave bed most days because of cramps, aches and every pain you can imagine. I went to every doctor around and I was told it was just female problems. I finally got into a specialist in Atlanta - it was endometriosis. I had surgery May 2nd to remove stage 2 endo and Ive been on the mend since. Ive definitely been more active, but my hormones are insane. I have tons of energy for a few days then I crash for a good week or two. Currently seeing a doctor about that too I have only seen one high school friend since I left. Ive stayed in contact with a few, but its just been so hard to do anything - especially being so far from everyone. I have a girlfriend; shes wonderful, but she lives across the country. We see each other when we can, but with her schooling its not a lot. Im going back to college in the fall. It really really sucks having her so far away AND being so far away from my 2 friends who are still in town. I just feel so stuck. I stay at home most days because I dont have the energy to do anything. I hang out with my parents and thats okay. I love them but its not the same as friends. My nieces and nephews come over a lot and theyre a lot of fun, but still its not the same. I just really want a support system thats NEAR ME.

I used to just starve myself most of the time when I was in HS. I wouldnt eat in any classes, I wouldnt take a snack. When people offer me something (like a class dessert or snack day where people bring in something to share) I wouldnt take anything. I still do this when Im 20 y/0 and havent gotten over it, and idk how to become comfortable eating infront of others.

Im 17 years old (M), and I have an incredible internship this summer at the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI) in Bethesda, MD (June 16August 9). The problem is that Ihave absolutely nowhere to stay, and because Im a minor, almost every housing option has flat-out refused me. I dont have family or friends nearby, and my parents are supportive but cant live with me there. Ive tried everything homestays, dorms, hostels, programs but no one will take me because of my age. Im scared I might lose this opportunity because I literally cannot find a safe, affordable place to live. I have about $850/month and my parents can sign any paperwork or consent forms needed. Please, if anyone has ANY leads, a host family, a program, a spare room, church groups, anything at all I will be forever grateful. I just want a chance to do this internship without losing it over something as basic as housing. Im quiet, responsible, and committed. Im begging for help here because I dont know where else to turn. Please, if you can help or even point me in the right direction, Ill be eternally thankful.

youngadults,2025-06-04 15:09:04,Parents preventing me from working,"I (20m) have been dead broke for the past 6 months since getting laid off from my full time job. I also owe a decent amount of money to close friends who have helped me out financially. I had always been the most financially responsible one among my friends ans family, but after I got laid off I was told by my father I wasn't allowed to get another job. His reasoning was because our household receives government assistance (food stamps and state provided health insurance) and if I were working, our household income would be too high to qualify for assistance. I also bought a vehicle last summer that since had blown a transmission that I've slowly been trying to repair since February (I know what I'm doing I just can't afford parts). So even if I were to disobey my father and get a job, I wouldn't have the transportation to get there. The main problems in my life are all the cause of one another. I need a job, I need to fix my car to get a job, I need a job to get the money to fix/replace my car, and I need both to move out. All the money I had saved I've had to spend/give to my parents to help with bills. More context; my father is in his early 50s and doesn't work for ""medical reasons"" so we depend on my mother's income to keep the bills paid, and have always just barely gotten by. My father doesn't collect disability so there's no financial assistance other than foodstamps. My mom only makes arround 30k a year to support our family of 5. For those who have made it this far, I need advice. What options do I have to get my life back together and get a job, transportation, and move out? I've kind of just been stuck in the same place in life since my savings ran out and now it feels like I'll be stuck in my parents house forever, broke, as the rest of my friends move on and make progress in their adult lives.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1l380cd/parents_preventing_me_from_working/,6

Some are getting married or finding regular jobs right away, and I cant help but compare myself and wonder if Im falling behind or missing something. Whats messing with my head even more is that Ive never really been interested in relationships like that Ive never seen marriage or dating as a priority for myself. But where I live, most of the women who have their own place (whove moved out or gained some independence) have done it by getting married.

Im 21 now and feeling some loss. I miss having that anonymous online space. This seems like a nice subreddit, but Im not getting the vibe that its the same sort of very casual and active subreddit. Heres a bigger question to relate this to a larger conversation; where are people finding community nowadays? I dont get it. Obviously people are more disconnected than ever. Civil society is dead and has been for decades. Social media has made communication faster and more instantaneous than ever but yet somehow also disconnected us more than ever.

Moving for university was my dream but I cant sleep without thinking about where the money for next months rent, groceries, and tuition will come from. I might have extend my degree by a year as well, and my scholarship is only for 4 years so that will put me in some crazy debt (~20k), + I also want to go to med school so thats even more debt. I just want to be comfortable, the work I have lined up is minimum wage 40 hours a week and its still barely enough to survive. Im not taking courses this summer so I have time to work 40 hours, but over the winter term and next summer term I am taking courses, so I have no idea how Im gonna afford to pay my rent next summer because I will have so little free time to work, and the time I do have will mainly go to studying to upkeep my gpa for med school.

I know we all come from different backgrounds and experiences, but I just wanted to open up and see how other students manage when life feels overwhelming. I live on my own in a not-so-great area its not perfect, but its what I can afford for now. My mom helps me with rent and other basics, but honestly, it breaks my heart knowing that almost everything she earns goes into keeping me afloat (rent, school, necessities). I try not to ask her for anything more because I know shes already sacrificing so much for me. I make a bit of money from tutoring, but now that were heading into the holiday season, that income is basically gone until August. Meanwhile, I still need money for food, transport to campus, electricity, toiletries, and now with winter here warm blankets. Even my tech is giving up on me my laptop only works while plugged in and my phone screen randomly goes blank. Ive talked to a few people in similar situations whove managed to make it through in ways Im not comfortable with (no judgment at all we all do what we need to survive), but I know I wouldnt be okay with myself if I took the same route. Getting a job sounds ideal, but my schedule makes it nearly impossible. Im usually on campus from 7:30am to 5pm (sometimes later even until 9pm during exams).

youngadults,2025-05-31 05:41:21,"I have no idea what happened to me. I am not really quite sure where I went wrong, or where to go from here either.","I just turned 22. I don't know how the last 4 years have passed. It feels like I turned 18 and graduated high school just a year ago, but it was four years ago. I started college the summer I graduated high school, but I floundered and meandered through every semester, dropping and switching between three majors, and have since dropped out having learned nothing - as I have did the bare minimum to pass, and/or have cheated my way through, and because I didn't invest myself into these classes. I dropped out. Now my graduating class from high school is graduating college, and entering the real world, while I am still in the same position as I was 4 years ago when I graduated high school. I don't know how the last 8, 10, or 12 years have passed either. I have been dealing with mental health problems and issues, along with Autism/Asperger's/ADHD, since I was at least 10-12. But they have passed, and they have passed with me going through problems upon problems with all of these problems just accumulating through the years. With little-to-no happy memories being made in all of this. I never had a friend growing up. I still don't have friends. I have only dated once, and only for a few months. Just about everyone that I have met in life seems to come-and-go, passing me by, just as life does. The only people that are close to me are family members, and the only person who has a positive relationship with me is my dad, everyone else in my family has strained relationships with me. I don't know, but I never developed myself as a person either. I never developed and cultivated any skills, hobbies, or passions. My personality isn't really one that is mines, it seems, but one that changes and adapt depending on the life situation that I'm presented with, like a mask that I'm forced to wear and drop, swap, and change as life situations change. I don't know if it is because I have lived much of my live passively, in-disassociation, not really living, but just existing, sometimes reacting to whatever life situation that I was being presented with in the moment. Or, if it is because much of my development in life was stunted due to years and years of constant, non-stop mental health/psychological issues and problems, and my Autism/Asperger's/ADHD. But, here I am, a 22 year-old who is as undeveloped and uncultivated as a 14 year-old, or even 10 year-old. I have developed suicidal thoughts throughout all of those years, on-and-off, never acted on them, and I don't know why, and I don't know whether it was a mistake to not commit suicide or not, but...I can't help but feel like...it is a reason why I'm lost at 22, because I remember being 13 and feeling like I will commit suicide by 18, and that I won't live to be an adult...but here I am 22, and I don't know what to do with myself now that I am now an adult. I don't know what to do. I don't know where the years have gone, or how they have passed, but they did. I don't know what to do now. I don't know with the 22 years of my life - in the context of interpreting, contextualizing, understanding, processing, and then making use of these 22 years to at least get value of them - but I am 22, and I will be 30, 40, 50, 60 soon as the years will pass. I am just as lost as I was when I was 18, 16, 14, 12, and even 10. I am lost. I don't know how to move on really from this point in-life, or if I should move on from this point at all, and just end it now. But I can't, for reasons such as the fact that ending it will affect others, and I can't stand that fact. This keeps me trapped in this limbo, this in-between period, where I feel like I only exist in-passing, with zero self-preservation, zero willpower, zero anything. Just as a Dead Man Walking in all but name. The worst part is that I know it's all my thought, because of how fucked up my psyche is, my mind is, my brain is. It has led me into being trapped and locked-up into this world of depression, anxiety, paranoia, anger, delusional obsessions, for years. And that is the worst part. I don't know what to do. I don't know what happened to me. I don't know what led to all of this. I don't know when, and how, I became this, and when, and how, my life became this. I don't know where to go from here. I don't know if I can go from here. I don't know if I want to go from here.

I enjoy the freedom I have to do things, I still play Roblox and do things I want because I can.. Simple.

In high school, I was fairly unpopular (theater kid, GSA, strict-ish parents & followed their rules) and didn't exactly do anything to help myself there (didn't party/smoke/drink, always spent my time working or on academics, stayed away from the typical reckless teenager things). I had a small friend group that was mostly the same and was fairly content with that. Once I graduated, I moved a few states away for college and changed myself almost completely. I have a great group of friends there, all who know me for the me that I am now, not who I was growing up. They know me as someone who wants to get out there, do a few stupid things, take risks, spend all night laughing/smoking/drinking around a campfire, explore an abandoned place, do anything in nature, etc., and I couldn't be happier about that. I moved back from school three weeks ago and have been pretty miserable. Most of my high school friends don't talk to each other anymore or moved, so I have about 4 people in the state that I actually spend any amount of time with. Even when I do see them, they suggest we sit and talk in a cafe or grab dinner at a sit-down restaurant, which is nice, but it's not exactly my thing. TL;DR: I have a reputation of being kinda stuck up in my hometown, but I'm not anymore.

youngadults,2025-05-28 11:06:29,Freshly graduated high schooler with no clue what's next,"I F18 graduated last Thursday, and when I got my diploma, stress about being an adult hit me. I believed I had more time before getting hit by the stress, but my plans are not going according to plan. My greatest wish I wanted to make true is to have a dorm or be away from my parents and siblings for a little bit as I am in college. My parents are emotionally draining and use me as a babysitter and for other things because I am the oldest. I wanted to go to community college and live near the college in their student housing area. I spent months stressing out about getting a spot and getting the classes I want, just for my parents to tell me the day before yesterday they did not like it. They believe I will not get the FULL college experience if I do not go to a university and will not meet new people. I wanted to go to community college to figure out what I don't like and what degree I want to pursue. I explained my reasoning, and we had disagreements, and last night we came up with 3 solutions: I will go to community college but commute from home, second, go to a big, well-known university I was accepted in, located in my state, or get a full-time job, and move out. After the heated discussion, I went out to get fresh air with my boyfriend and when I came back, they decided to have another serious conversation with me. They told me that how I am spending my summer is what children do, and now that I am an adult, I cannot hang out with friends every day, all day. I was confused by this convo because one moment I am a child and another I am an adult. Ever since I was 15, they confused me with such things. As I am writing this at 5AM I am scared that a new problem will happen.I am hurt, confused, and feel alone. I am not sure what to do because it feels like more problems every day, and I feel like I cannot go to anyone about them anymore. I can't seek guidance from my school counselor anymore, my mom is going to get rid of my therapist, and I am scared to talk to my godmother about these issues over the phone, as we live an hour away from each other, and I fear what she will tell me. In private, she makes small comments about my mother's parenting, often disagreeing with her, and I think she suspects something.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1kxe9s7/freshly_graduated_high_schooler_with_no_clue/,2

Told me that I can't cut my hair because people of God doesn't cut their hair . Bro wtf. I was so stunned, I was speechless. There was several times we were having conversations far from leading into religion and suddenly there's Bible verses and stories and when I ask why was she bringing religion into a conversation about BOTTLED WATER, God was gonna curse me for asking.

My sink works wonderfully now!! And you know what the best part is? I didn't spill a drop of water. I didn't cry. I didn't panic. I didn't need to call someone for help. I succeeded! All by myself!

Next year I'll be a senior in college, and Im scared. Due to mental illness and a genetic disorder I didnt get diagnosed till last year, I feel like I'm emotionally stunted. I struggle with a healthy work life balance where I work a lot on school and am unable to do anything else and get burnt out, so any free time is mainly spent playing games, drawing, or writing because I'm too tired to socialize. All I care about is having time to indulge my hobbies and I dont really have any interest in marriage or kids because, simply put, there isn't enough time for that in the day. I know this is immature, but I like being my mom's baby, I like traveling with her. Change petrifies me. I get my school work done, I do my best to handle my adult responsibilities even when I really dont want to, but I know once I'm out of school I'm expected to be a ""real"" adult. And I dont like it. I like writing, I like drawing my characters with friends, I like playing video games, and I like traveling with my mom. I know most people feel sad they dont have a relationship, but my life is so much less stressful and better without it. I love my routine, my friends, and I'm scared that I'll be left behind. My interests are juvenile and no matter what I do, I know I can't stop the passage of time. I dread nothing more than being unable to indulge my hobbies because I have a kid I have to take care of. I dread being exhausted all the time from work. I dread being too old for my interests. My parents marriage and divorce turned me off from the concept of marriage, but I never thought I'd be this disintersted in romance. I enjoy the chase then loathe the commitment. I was a pessimistic, depressed child and was often told that I'd make a great adult. But I'm not. I'm a horrible adult. I dont understand any of it. I'm immature and selfish, I feel like much of my adolescence was stolen from me, but I can't use that excuse forever. I dont want to be left behind. I dont want to be alone. I always told myself that once I was in college I'd stop my immature interests and engage fully with the world around me. I dont like drinking, I dont like anything about adulthood. I feel like im too old to feel this way. Sometimes I tell myself that I'm still young, that I'm allowed to feel this way, but am I lying to myself? Im stressed, im scared, and I dont know what to do. My parents worked so hard, they supported me through a lot, and I've repaid them by being a loser.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1krgy5f/why_cant_i_feel_like_an_adult/,3

youngadults,2025-05-19 14:45:20,I don't feel like an adult and honestly i don't want to grow up,"I'm 21 and I don't feel like anything has changed as I've gotten older. Yes, i'm studying in uni(i hate it tho) and had a really fulfilling job, searching for a new one now, but i don't really feel like i'm a grown adult. Even if i had a job and was completely independent, i would still feel like i'm like 17 years old guy. I don't know what is the source of this feeling, maybe it's this developmental delay with which i was diagnosed when i was a child, maybe something else. I just don't feel like i'm fitting in around people of my age. I can pretend like i'm an adult as much as i want, but deep down i know, that aside of obvious things like getting a job and anything like this, i just want to have a simple and sometimes teenage fun with my friends, who now can only discuss their life and everyday chores and don't want to have any pseudophilosophical half intellegent-half stupid conversations anymore. People of my age like to go to bars/restaraunts, talk about relationships and careers, but i honestly miss a simple joy of just walking to the sunset discussing either something serious, either completely goofy. Everyone just became so dead serious and i can't understand that. You can be an adult, but why you all of the sudden stopped doing that stuff, that brought joy to our lives and become someone, who just discuss our ex classmates lifes and some regular stuff? I miss my friends of those days. But one of them completely isolated himself, other just busy with university and third hanged himself a year ago. I wish we could keep that spark of childishness together, but i lost all of them. And in general i don't see any reasons why should i 'grow up', like, i can live my life without losing this spark of life in me and fucntion in society by wearing a mask of an adult when doing something serious. I just want to become this kind of manchild, who has a good career and can afford to buy expensive toys like cars/motorbikes/travel, but treat this things with a teenage enthusiasm and joy.

youngadults,2025-05-18 05:30:43,"I (14M) lost my best friend (14F) who I love, but I never told her. We were close, even flirty sometimes, but she got distant, and now I dont know what to do.","Im 14, and for almost four years, N (also 14) was my best friend the person I trusted most in the world. We met when we were just 11, and from the start, something clicked between us. Shes quiet, calm, and fiercely independent, the steady force to my wild, goofy, and sometimes messy energy. People used to say we were like yin and yang totally different but perfectly balanced. N wasnt just any friend she really saw me. Not just the loud jokes or the surface stuff, but the deeper me, the one I barely showed anyone else. She had this way of being so personally affectionate, not in a loud way, but in the little things a smile that felt like it was just for me, teasing me in that special way only close friends do, or just how shed laugh when I said something dumb but funny. People noticed us too sometimes friends teased us about being close, calling us cute or joking about us being more than friends. We didnt say anything, but those moments felt warm and electric. Over time, things got complicated. There were moments that felt flirty, subtle but real little jokes, shy looks, teasing touches. I didnt fully understand what I was feeling back then, but deep down I knew I loved her. I have for a long time. But I was scared. I waited for her to say something first, hoping shed feel the same way. But that moment never came. Maybe she got tired of waiting. Maybe she started to get bored of me, or maybe I just wasnt enough anymore. Whatever it was, she grew distant. Then one day, we had a small confrontation. It wasnt huge, but it shook me. After that, I tried to act like it didnt hurt I joked, teased, tried to be my usual goofy self around her because I wanted her to be happy, even if it meant pushing me away. I wanted her to have the best life, without me being a problem or a burden. But inside, it crushed me. I felt like I was losing the person who had been my safe place when no one else was there. Why do I still feel so sad and depressed? Because she was my anchor when everything else felt like it was falling apart. She was the one I turned to when I felt lost. Losing her feels like losing part of myself. And then, it all stopped. The texts faded, the laughs disappeared, and she just vanished from my life. I dont have her number anymore my phone was stolen, and I lost all my contacts. I have no way to reach her. Now shes being homeschooled, so it feels like Ill never see her again. I feel like I need to tell her everything that I love her, that Im sorry if I hurt her without realizing it, that she meant more than words could ever say. But I dont know how. Or if I even should. Should I try to reach out through a mutual friend? Maybe on social media? Or write her a letter? Or is it better to just accept it and try to move on even if that breaks me inside? I dont want to be annoying or make things worse for her. I want her to be happy, truly happy. But at the same time, I dont want to live with this regret forever. To be honest, this is even harder because Im dealing with ADHD, OCD, Autism, and depression. Sometimes my mind races with thoughts and fears that dont make sense to anyone but me. Its like this sadness wont let go. If youve ever been through something like this lost someone you cared about deeply, wished youd told them sooner, or didnt know how to fix what broke please, give me your advice. Am I wrong for feeling like this? For still hoping I can fix things? Or should I let her go and try to heal on my own? Thanks for taking the time to read all of this. It really means a lot. A EDIT: Hey everyone, thanks again for all the replies and honesty. Ive been reading through everything, and I get that sometimes feelings arent returned the way we want and thats a really hard truth to face. Its painful, confusing, and it messes with your head. But for me, its not about forcing anything or making her feel guilty. What I really want is just to tell her the truth. To be honest about what I feel, even if it doesnt change anything. We were really close. Like, more than just friends close. We laughed together, teased each other, and yeah, there were moments when we touchedhugged evenand looked at each other in ways that made us both blush and look away. There were times when we just caught each others gaze, silent but loud with what wasnt said, and both of us seemed to carry this sadness maybe because we couldnt talk like we used to anymore. It felt like something was still there, beneath the surface, even if it was hidden or complicated by everything going on. I still care deeply. But I think were too far apart now, too tangled in everything that happened, and maybe its too late. Still, I need her to know the truth, even if it hurts. Its hard for me really hard with my ADHD, OCD, autism, and depression making every step feel heavier. Ive struggled with how to express this, how to be strong enough to say whats in my heart without breaking. I lost my phone, so we dont have contact anymore. Shes being homeschooled now, and I dont know if well ever see each other again. That scares me. I miss what we had the friendship, the closeness, the moments when it felt like maybe there was more. And even when things got rough or we had small fights, I never stopped caring. I just wanted her to be happy, even if that meant being without me. I know this isnt easy for anyone. Its messy and painful. But if I dont say it, Ill regret it. I dont want to live carrying this secret in my chest, wondering what could have been if I was braver or if we had more time. So here I am, putting it out there no pressure, no expectations just the truth.

They might low-key want to show off their photos to their peers, so they look successful, far-ahead in life, and happy. Being married and having kids is a great thing, but some young people might think that it's the only thing that displays success. \- Some people travel or go on study-abroad semesters for the photo opportunities. Sure, they know they'll have a great time, but they also want those Instagram-esque moments. The idea of the semester sounds cool, but they know it could be very stressful for them.

As I am typing this, i am 2 days fresh from the breakup. Long story short, we broke up because she realized that i am very restrictive about myself, and I get into my head about, for example, going back home very soon, and this pattern is recurring. I consciously attempted to prolong our dates, but when the clock hit 7, i get anxious to get back home soon. Although my parents arent really calling me or asking me where I'm at. Unless it gets past 8, i dont get a call. And there are a lot of other issues with me, like not handling conflicts well or, being anxiously attached, and a lot of other things. I am not a risk taker. She also stated that I dont really have a personality of my own which, when i look deep into myself, is true. It is made up by my parents when i was a kid and then i never really grew out of it. I stuck to their understanding of morals and principles and it really hurts now that i never really experienced what it was to be a rebellious teenager, and be, a ""healthy human"" Now when all of this surfaced, i came across this term of ""Helicopter Parenting"" and when i read about it, it makes sense what they are really doing to me. And if this continues, I will never live my life to the fullest. And it is not like, they still have a strong hold on me, but i get the anxiety sometimes to fight with my parents and imagine the consequences. I was never physically abused. It was mental really. It was the silent treatments and offloading the anger onto someone else that really got me to be anxiously attached. And to top it off, i was never really given a chance to make my own decisions and to fail and get back up and have real experiences. Now all i am stuck doing is routine. I need to come out of this, and i need to start having conversations, whether it is coming home late or making them understand that I like to see women to have real genuine connections and it is not something that i want to have a fling with someone, or a multitude of things. I recently succeeded in removing the app ""Life360"" which shows in real time where we are for ""safety reasons"" but i lied to them telling that it is a Chinese app that will misuse the location. So, cheers to that. How and where should i start this process of having an open communication with my parents? My parents are 60M and 55F. They have a fairly orthodox views of the world, especially when it comes to women and it gives me real anxiety that there will be a point where our views will never match and i will be facing some real unplesant consequences.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1kou8qt/struggling_to_set_boundaries_with_helicopter/,2

I'd love any kind of advice on how to hunt for jobs that would best suit my physical health as well as recommendations on how to get out of my house and try to make friends as an adult with minor anxiety!",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1klescg/im_23f_living_with_my_parents_trying_to_progress/,3

youngadults,2025-05-11 19:34:09,"23, dont know how to feel about my age. I live like a teen, even tho im not. Feeling extremly depressed, behind in life and constantly thing about what is or is not age appropriate for me.","Just for context, let me say that after being a loser all my childhood, and all my teenage years, spent them being unhappy and alone. I started living, feeling, and accepting myself as a real adolescent around 18/19, discovering that i can be unhappy but at least with other people, i started living the life, the parties the small mischiefs, i was just starting to like it, and, in the blink of an eye, BANG! im almost im my mid 20s, a fucking full grown man now and i dont really feel it. Young, sure, but not \*that type\* of young. The type where everything is not just painful, its romantically painful, when you can afford to get stuck and people will help you, will protect you. You can afford to feel identity twoards your sadness, and to waste occasions and make bad decisions, because there's time to change (afterall youre not an adult yet!) Ill say it. I was in pain throughout my teens but it was different. There was beauty in that pain, it was strong awful, but like a soft, mellow agony, in which i found identity and order. Now pain just makes your life a mess, and you have to try to keep your shit together anyway, while the world starts to expect you to pay it back for all the time other people took care of you. Its awful. So i start to overthink anything wondering if its age appropriate, or acting like a real adult. For example i live with my parents, when im eating out with them, and we go to the counter they pay and im just standing beside them taller than them with a full beard. Its weird. or when family friends come, with sons my age and we hang out separatly from the others, like going to my room and play games, despite being adults just like them, I start to get a weird exitment about it being a very teenager thing. At the same time, one of my childhood friends is my age, married, with kids. Im at the first year of Uni, with many people who are 18. I envy them. Or in general the way i like to act with friends or to hang out its very adoslecent while they are more ""mature""so to say, in the way they talk and act. I recently read that the brain ends its development around 25 and have been obsessed with the idea of being ""still growing up"" having a bit of ""that"" youth going on, and maybe not having to be a real-real adult for another 2 years... I started to love adolescence essentially just after i exited it, and feel guilty for not enjoying it when i had it. Now im not sure what i am anymore. Im not a teen, but i cannot relate to ""adult"" adults. I cannot by the love of God see teenager characters in movies and such, because i start feeling jealous and start wondering if i relate too much to them. How i wish i was 18-19 again. Its dumb i know. Fallen in love with my youth, just as i watch it slip away between my fingers.

Im a 22M, shy and introverted, and Im trying to figure out how to explore a potential deeper connection with her without making things awkward. We first got close in our 2nd semester, sitting together in lectures and building a comfortable dynamic. She was fine with me holding her hand during class, and Id sometimes rest my hand on her thighit felt natural for us back then. Shes sweet, wears a hijab, and has a calm, quiet personality. We didnt talk much, just shared a chill vibe. I missed a lot of college after that due to illness, so we drifted apart for a while. Now in our 6th semester, were sitting together again during labs and chatting more casually. Shes made comments that feel like hints, like mentioning our height difference while talking about relationships or saying, My future wife will be lucky (odd phrasing, I know). Recently, while waiting for a viva, we were sitting close, and I was holding her hand like before. She mentioned seeing a classmate with his girlfriend watching a sunset and said, I want to watch a sunset too. Later, she leaned in close, and her thigh brushed against mine in a way that felt intentional. Im not great at reading signals, and I dont want to misinterpret her actions or make her uncomfortable. Id like to explore if theres potential for more, but Im unsure how to approach this as an introvert. What are some subtle, low-risk ways I can deepen our connection, like suggesting a casual hangout to watch a sunset, and how can I gauge her response without risking our friendship? Just some additional info: Weve been in the same friend group since 2nd semester, but were not super close with others.

But there are thought patterns I want to correct, behaviors I want to fix, issues I want to discuss, which are not easily addresed without somebody there who will keep me accountable, who will communicate with me and maybe take a less than direct approach in dealing with the problem(exercises, specific journalling, whatever). Okay I've lost the original point of my question. Maybe. How has it worked out for you in the past? Will it suffice in addressing my problems?

youngadults,2025-05-06 05:19:58,i need advice please :(,"Hi guys im after some advice or help on a situation between myself (19 f), my bf (19 m), my dad and my bfs mum. this is going to sound so fucked up but its my reality at the moment . My boyfriend and I have been together since February 2024. Not long before we started dating, in January 2024, his parents went through a divorce. After that, his dad moved out, and he was living with his mum and two younger sisters. Fast forward to early January 2025, our families finally met. It felt like a big step for us, and at the time, it all seemed fine. But just a few weeks later, in late January, I found out my own parents were getting a divorce too. It wasnt a total shock, Id felt like something was off for the last couple of years but it still hit hard. My mum moved into the spare room at my family home, and shes since started seeing someone else, which Im actually okay with. But around the same time, something weird started happening. My dad and my boyfriends mum started texting each other. It seemed casual at first, but the messaging turned into them going on what they claimed werent dates, even though it was obvious they were spending more and more time together. My boyfriend and I both felt super uncomfortable with the whole thing. Wed been together for almost a year before our parents even met, and suddenly it felt like they were trying to start something of their own, completely disregarding how that would affect us. We confronted them, explained how we felt, and asked them to stop. We just wanted our boundaries respected, but they didnt listen. Instead, they kept sneaking around, lying about where they were and who they were with. It was honestly so disappointing and hurtful, especially coming from the people who are meant to protect and respect us. After a while, it felt like they were treating us like we were the problem, like we were being dramatic for not wanting our relationship turned into some awkward, tangled mess. Eventually, wed had enough. We told them they needed to stop whatever was going on because they werent being honest with us, and they were completely ignoring how uncomfortable it was making us feel. But even after that, they still went on two more non-dates, lied about being together, and gaslit us into thinking we were imagining things. That was the final straw. My boyfriend and I decided we couldnt keep letting them disrespect us like this. We cut them off, told them they were no longer invited to any of our future milestones, birthdays, graduations, anything and weve started looking for a place to move out so we can finally have some peace and distance. Its hard though because we live 2 hours away from each other and are both full time uni students. Now, apparently, our parents have ended whatever they had going on. But instead of owning up to how they crossed boundaries, theyre blaming us saying we ruined their only source of happiness. That part stings the most. Honestly, I dont know what to do now. I feel like Ive lost trust in the people I should be able to rely on, and Im stuck between trying to protect my relationship and dealing with this emotional mess our parents have left behind.

youngadults,2025-05-05 16:43:47,Studying abroad,"Hi everyone, I'm a 14 year old 15 in June, girl from France (my parents are from Nigeria), currently finishing 9th grade in July (some teachers told me it's equivalent to freshman year in the U.S.), and I'm aiming to do an academic comeback in high school to get top grades because as I was growing, my mental health was going from worse to worse and my parents didn't seem to care (and they were the cause of 95% of it), (even though my grades are good and for some teachers very good but I can do better). I have some questions and if possible advice concerning studying abroad as a French student. So I'm going to give a little context (it will be long, so I hope you have time for all this ) My goal is to study law in the U.S. after high school but I didn't told my mother and I kind of told my dad (he knows that I don't want to continue school in France even though France is good) Ive always been motivated to succeed, but I come from a complicated family background (very complicated). My dad lives in London with another part of my family (half-siblings) since I was 10, after a major family conflict between our mothers (polygamous relationship I think, we almost have the same ages). Hes emotionally distant and doesnt support us financially, though he sometimes sends gifts. My mom is raising several kids (the one before me from a previous relation) alone with financial struggles. My younger siblings love asking her things that is very $$$, but me I can't, I feel really guilty (I'm the child that barely asks for gifts) It took me 3 years to ask 15 euros for something that I really wanted and even when christmas comes my siblings (not my eldersister) asks things that cost 100 euros and me like 20 euros and I feel bad. While I respect her for all she does, she isnt emotionally supportive either, she always criticize my appearance because she's scared that people will bully me if I dress a certain way (my puberty started very early, like 8-9 years I think) I've been bullied once but not because of that. I know she wants to protect me but she is doing it the wrong way. I cant really talk to her about my future plans because she believes Ill stay near her forever and i am planning everything in secret because I can bet all what I have that she will refuse or discourage me to let me apply in any schools. Even right now I feel like she doesn't care about my studies, like when am working or reading (because I have big difficulties in math but I love reading) she tells me to stop, that it's too much when It's only been 20 minutes. In reality, I want to take control of my life. I've been in an international program (SIA with literature, history, and geography taught completely in English, and I've been speaking since I was born) for 4 years, so my English is strong. Ive started researching scholarships since finances are tight. Id love to hear your advice or stories: Has anyone managed to study abroad despite family challenges? How did you handle unsupportive parents? Any tips for planning an international education path without financial or emotional help? Do you have an idea when I can tell them? Because I feel like if I tell my mom right now, I'm going to lose hope. I've done it for some dreams of mine and right now I don't believe in them again because of her. Thanks so much.

youngadults,2025-05-04 04:30:03,Making best friends in your 20s,Is it just me who is sat thinking that I have lost my chance to make best friends. I have a great few mates from when I was in school but honestly we are so different as a girl these people are just guys and I do feel like I need a close female friend who I can call whenever about anything and whos active and always down for stuff.. That sounds like I being super demanding but I do feel like Im loosing hope on being able to find people as it gets harder through time as we dont go to school everyday ect. Any tips on where u can actually make good friendships ? I have hobbies already - I go climbing but nothing permanent ever comes from that. Often my climber friends are not my age or not that similar to me besides our joint interest in climbing. It feels like everyone already has their best friend from when they were young and theres no way if I become friends with them that I can ever become a part of that loop as Im late to the party.

youngadults,2025-05-02 07:17:57,How cooked do you think I am? (It's my 23rd birthday today),"So, long story short... i just turned 23 today, and i did some reflection and came to the conclusion that not only am i cooked.... I am boiled, fried, and roasted. Let me explain. I grew up poor, with a severely autistic younger brother prone to extremely violent meltdowns against himself and my mum. My dad walked out from the very start, leaving us alone. So, at the age of 11, as my brothers meltdowns got even worse against my mum, i stepped in and started becoming like a 24/7 bodyguard for her, and a 24/7 carer for my brother. There was one time I had a lie in bed on Saturday for fewer than 10 minutes, and in that ten minutes, it got so bad, my mum had to lock her self in the bathroom to stop him from harming her. I raced downstairs when I heard the commotion trying to break in to get her, and got inbetween him and the door, and spent the rest of the day stopping him from getting at my mum. This was commonplace growing up for me. There was times like when we had to take my brother up to the hospital, i had to physically pull him off my mum 8 times in the span of an hour, and hold him back from getting her. This was commonplace for me. This meant i couldn't go out... socialise, hang out with friends... make friends.... or be a teenager or enjoy my late childhood. I stayed at home during university, and yeah. It was rough. Very rough. Anyway, the UK hiring market is dead now for cyber security, so that was a wasted folley... so i'm in huge amounts of student loan debt.... unable to get a job in cyber security.... no friends, never having ever had one, no relationships, i have been out, but for 4 hours a year only since i turned 19 to wingfest.... and there's nothing else. I've never been independent... never been myself.... never joined a club... hooked up..... and i'm kind of screwed. Mentally... i'm not doing so well. There's a whole lot more, to the point that getting sold for a bottle of white lightning when i was 4 by my drunk uncle is considered the light stuff, and all of this is barely 1/3 of it.... so yeah... mentally, i'm not doing so well.... to the point i still have teddy bears. I'm... cooked i think. Any advice and you opinions would be much appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1kcuzk5/how_cooked_do_you_think_i_am_its_my_23rd_birthday/,16

I want to be close to people. I just dont know how to stop being scared of it. Im also transferring to a university in August so thats even more terrifying. A new place, environment, and new people.

I just dont know if the feelings mutual or if Im stuck in the good friend zone. Some quick background: * Shes recently gotten out of a bad relationship and a short rebound one. Shes told me she has trust issues now, but wants to be in a relationship eventually. * Shes invited me to hang out with her and her friends a few times. We even went clubbing and she was super affectionate dancing with me, holding hands, touching my face, laying her head on my lap, and playing with my hair. She even said, ""I look like such a pookie"" and that kind of made my night lol. * Recently, we grabbed coffee and a dessert together. It was more lowkey but personal we talked about relationships and trust and laughed a lot. * She also invited me to her friends birthday next week. * I mentioned checking out a cat caf (we both like cats) and she seemed interested. * When we parted ways, I said we should do this more often and she said yes. I talked to my guy friends some think I should make a move fast before I lose the chance. They have told me Im moving too slow and risk getting stuck in the friend zone. One even suggested a whole plan to escalate things physically over dinner and drinks next weekend, but that doesnt really align with how I want to approach this. I want something that grows naturally and respectfully. At the same time, I know that staying too neutral forever might confuse things. My questions: * Does this sound like romantic interest or just friendly closeness? * Is it okay to ask her out to dinner one-on-one soon? * How do I make things clearer without being too forward? * How do I move forward without overwhelming her or sabotaging what weve built?

youngadults,2025-04-29 00:46:45,Does anyone else worry about alcohol? Should I worry?,"I 19F, have a family of alcoholics and Im just starting to realize how bad it really is. my dad was an abusive alcoholic, I have been no contact for 5 years so idk if hes gotten any help or got sober. My mom is just horrible and affects me the worst. Shed come home everyday, drunk so driving drunk or would come home and start drinking right away. She got a dui, totaled a car, said cruel things to me, hit me before over car keys. The drinking has slowed down recently since she got into a relationship but as the weeks go by she keeps drinking more. My oldest brother 33, is a drug addict, coke and weed, always struggling with money and homelessness. I recently went to visit both of my brothers, and he told me he stays up most of the night drinking alone, which i thought was weird bc i was up that night also and didnt hear a single thing from him, didnt even have the tv on but he was hungover af the next day. My other brother 26, has 4 kids, I used to spend a lot of time with him before I moved and he drank a lot, never didnt have beer with him. We discussed how much our mom drinks and he sees no issue, he said he drinks at least 3 24 packs of beer a week. I went to his house and he had full and empty beers all over the house it was a gross thing to have around little kids. They offered me some and I gladly declined since Im driving and he kinda gave me heck for that. His gf that recently had a baby also seems to drink a lot, we were there 2 hours and she drank a lot of coolers in that time at least 6 at 1 in the afternoon , I noticed her cans all over too but not near as much as the beer. With my brothers I dont say a thing bc they will get mad easily and we dont have close relationships for me to have the right to say anything. But my mom I live with and have been taking care of her the last year. I rarely drink, only occasionally on weekends watching a hockey game or concerts, but when I do my mom gives me hell, Im a hypocrite apparently. I dont even drink to get drunk Ill have 2 maybe 3 coolers and thats all. Im only 19, I feel like Im missing out Ive never even been to a bar. Its not like I want to be an alcoholic and Im worried I will end up like the rest of my family. But I feel Im completely different from them, I rarely drink, and when Im stressed or upset, I have ways to cope, I have a journal or I just cry it out, they all just drink or do drugs to ease their pain. Do I even bother with alcohol? I enjoy it but not if everyone is gonna think Im a hypocrite and try to pick a fight. But I also want to experience the things other young people do, I want to go out and meet people but my family just sets me back by either saying mean stuff to me or just the thought of oh maybe this is alcoholism just like them? Anyone else experience something like this? Whats should I do?

He occasionally jokes at my expense when I'm showing or explaining something genuine, and sometimes leaves me feeling unheard when I say stuff like ideas etc. I will say this happens rarely but has become more and more frequent recently. For example, I sent him a snapchat of an old wrist watch that my dad gave me a while ago and asked for his thoughts on if I should incorporate it into my ""fit"". Because lately we've been kinda getting into a self improvement phase which involves dressing nicer etc etc. Anyway, I asked for his opinion on the wrist watch and he just said ""Thats so silly."" I asked wdym silly? and he defined the word silly even though I assume most people would explain why the watch was silly. I asked why he thought the watch was silly and he said ""oh idk I just felt like saying it"". Usually I'm not bothered by that stuff but I was asking for genuine opinions and honesty.

youngadults,2025-04-25 16:59:29,19 think I have to drop out of college and pretty beat up about it,"So I've been studying computer science which I've really liked honestly (have considered switching to more hardware side though) and for the first year and a half did pretty good I even made the deans list which was cool. But the entire time I've been working 2 jobs, even 3, most my schedule being 8-12 school MWF and 12-11 work with TTH being about the same. When I had three jobs I would work an hour before class and in between any breaks. It wasn't really sustainable but I did it for a year and a half so, this semester I took a two maths (cal II and statistics) align with data structs/digital logic/ai and I guess burned myself out I don't know but I was doing good for the first semester than during midterms tired from studying and work i slept through multiple exams or woke up late and got there half awake. I started doing pretty bad so I dropped down to 2 jobs and then my dogs medical bills happened, my first car broke down. I don't live my with parent and she isn't able to help me much or support any way, I pay all own my bills. I got dropped from her health insurance recently and haven't been able to afford going to the doctors really so I've been using a Hubble free trial to get contacts. My insurance plan is by myself so it's really expensive for just liability. I've been missing so much school to work and my grades aren't looking good, I have a couple hours a week for actual hobbies or my own time. I'm pretty down about my entire situation and had to tell one my college mentor figures when they asked when will they see me in class again that I'm likely dropping out. Almost started crying at work. I just feel a bit like a failure, growing up pretty poor I though college was my one way out and now my head just hurts everytime I think about how I failed. I know I could always go back or still do good outside of college I just feel terrible. I work all the time my hands and knees hurt, I've amassed a good ammount of debt from not having time to cook much anymore. TLDR : working too much to work down debt/bills grades dropped a lot, no outside support, feel like a failure need advice, im sorry if wrong sub for it",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1k7pz0d/19_think_i_have_to_drop_out_of_college_and_pretty/,3

That guy ghosted me. I found out yesterday that hes in a relationship. My stupid ass was stuck on him. I cried myself eyes out laying on my balcony at 3am drunk af. Anyways this evening I was talking to my sister and we were joking about boys and how we are all grown. She has 3 kiddos and I realized that Ill be turning 26 soon.

youngadults,2025-04-15 19:30:51,I got hit on by a 45+ yr old coworker the other day on a night out and I cant stop thinking about it. I feel disgusting.,"Its not leaving my brain even though I want it to. Mostly because I think I was flirting back too despite turning him down a couple of times. And there were times where I was like walking away and he pulled me back using my arm really roughly, or he put slid his hand around my back and waist and I just feel so confused about it and Im literally cringing about it. I didnt want him to. I kind of just wanted him to leave me alone but you know when everyones in their cliques and youre just standing there and he started talking to me again. Im in my early 20s, so technically its not weird, and I want to be seen as an adult but the more I think about it, the more its weird because I was literally playing Minecraft on my iPad just now and I was thinking why would a man whos had so many years of life experience hit on a girl who plays Minecraft. And I cant stop thinking about the fact that I was saying no, yet kept talking to him. I was just trying to be friendly and yeah maybe I played into the fact I was getting attention from someone but I said shit like youre too old for me and in the next sentence I said my family are all older than me so Im used to being around older people. Like, its probably my fault that he kept trying even though I turned him down because I remember he bought me a drink after I turned him down and he said Im saying this as a friend because you turned me down earlier, so I dont fancy you now. And I made a jokey comment saying oh thats cheeky, you immediately stopped fancying me because I said no. And I didnt mean it the way it come out (all flirty) I just meant like oh so you were trying your luck but then he the rest of the night he kept trying and fuck sake man. I need to get this out of my head because its been a couple of days and Im sure hes forgotten all about it. Like ew. Ew. Ew. Ew. Luckily hes not apart of the office Im in, so I dont see him. But Im honestly just embarrassed that I played into it. Im pretty sure I said he was good looking for an older person, and said Im glad someone is when he said hes into me. Can someone, anyone, just put my mind at ease. This is affecting me wayyy more than it should be. I dont know if its my fault because even though Im an adult, should he not know better than to go after the youngest person in the office? Is this my fault for wanting to be seen as an adult. And Im so embarrassed because a lot of what I was saying, in my head sounded mature, but in reality Im sure it wasnt. This is such a car crash and I feel so stupid. How do I forget about it? Im pretty sure I told a bunch of the office too that he was coming onto me so I hope they dont remember that because Im pretty sure he wasnt as drunk as the rest of us but I wasnt as drunk as the rest of the office either. So its not like I wasnt coherent. Im pretty sure hes got kids my age and is married too. Sorry for this random post, I just have to get this off my chest because I shouldnt be thinking about it at all by now but its all I have thought about for the last few days. Im so stupid. Ew.

I grew up (since the age of 1) in Taiwan and only viewed the US as my summer vacation (and even when I did come to the US for the summer camp I stayed at my Aunts house so it was still pretty Taiwanese if you know what I meant). I am now in college and I plan on staying in the USA for job. (I want to work in Nuclear Power so I think I dont have much choices considering Taiwan literally has like two barely functioning plants and have had protests against building/using more nuclear power). Having spent 18 years in Taiwan made me love the place. The food, the weather (I used to hate the heat but the winter in the US make me chronically sick and depressed), the boys (this is probably because my college are full of nerds and frat-boys no in-between) and the mobility (I dont have a car cuz my parents think I am too young to drive alone even though I am in my 20s. My hometown has metro but my college town only have unreliable bus). I dont know if I hate my college life because of my school, the US, or just simply because I left my family. And with the current political climate I am always worried to wake up the next day and see news about China taking over Taiwan. (Honestly being taken over isnt that bad considering they might even nuke the whole island.)

I just graduated feom a very reputed tier 1 university, currently trying to build a business in interior design. Which is going weird as i dont have contacts in the industry so i am building my image but its so so difficult, i feel everybody is out there to stab me. It feel like i am running a race where my legs are chained to the ground. I get freelance work which has pretty good pay but i still do not feel its enough? I want to get more and more. I have never studies in the past yet here i am burning myself out. 2. I have no family backup whatsoever. My family is moving to the states but i will not get to go as i am too old now according to their rules. And 3ven if i get to go there, it will be 3 years from now which will make me 26, and in Indian culture, thats the age to get marry or plan marriage. - even if i dont follow this which is fine i have anither issue. I WANT to study masters in the states and i have a hugh chance of getting into the university i want to with my grades but unfortunately due to my file issues, i wont be allowed student visa - thats what they say. Even if i do get it, i will have to pay 40lakhs inr for the course i want to and mind you the other expences of going there and living there. Which i dont have, neither my fam. If i choose to do masters in other countries, my fam says they might not allow (or atleast suggest) me to go there because of the current world politics. I have a fear of - 1. Not making it, by this i mean nit been able to build my own design company 2. Not being able to study masters and get to live in a different country alone and experience a new culture 3. Not being able to earn a good sum of capital for myself (by working under someone but not in india as it doesnt pay much) 4. All this sums upto not being able to earn enough for me to even travel to other countries, maybe i will get to travle 2/3 countries but whats the point then? I have so much potential if regards with my skills and creativity but so less of a backup or support to help me out. I am trying but what if it takes me more than 10 years? I am not asking for 1000s of clients, for me to earn enough for a year and sustain a healthy sum for future while saving up for travel every year, it will only take 10 clients at max a year. But it is so difficult out there. I cry myself to sleep everynight. Idk why i feel this way, i have never been this sad. I want a way out of this feeling.

youngadults,2025-04-11 05:52:58,Struggling college student (20F),"Hi. Ill try to make this quick since this is probably a problem many people have already heard and/ or dealt with before. Im doing really terrible in college right now and Im just feeling so empty and discouraged. At first, I felt anger and frustration but now all I can feel is numb. It makes me wish that I paid more attention while I was in high school and had a better understanding of college and school in general. Im in my 3rd semester of community college (technically 4th since I took a summer semester as well) and Im retaking two classes. One class Im retaking is English, which is actually my best subject. I messed up on my final the previous time I took the class because I misread the instructions and forgot to do a portion of the final, causing me to fail the class altogether. When I figured out what happened I cried for the first time in a while. I was really upset, but Ive kind of come to terms with it now and didnt let it determine my worth and future. As for the other class Im currently retaking, I simply failed because I had not worked hard enough in the class. My school divides lab (30%) and lecture (60%). Last semester I failed the lab portion of the class. This semester, Im failing the lecture portion of the class which is arguably worse. Even with my lab grade being an A now, my lecture grade is beyond saving at this point in the semester. I had already emailed and talked to my professor about my struggles in the class and asked for help with studying, however I wasnt really helped out much. Now I think I am going to fail the class again, which is really frustrating considering how hard I have been working to prevent this from happening. I live at home with my family while working a few days out of the month in a school for little kids. I think that I manage my time pretty well considering how busy my life gets but I just cant seem to do well in school. I even got diagnosed with ADHD, however I feel that there is something more going on with me. Whether or not there is an issue going on with me or not its really not an excuse for me to be performing so poorly. My parents dont have the money to pay for my schooling since I have 3 other younger siblings and they provide for their parents and other family members (my parents immigrated here). Fafsa wont give me any grants or anything like that so I have to pay back what I owe with loans. I dont even have my own vehicle that I can use to drive to work and school so I use my moms. Of course I am grateful for this, but I end up spending a lot of my paychecks paying for gas which makes it hard to save. I think I have a generous amount of savings for my age (20 years old) from work and money fafsa sent me back that I didnt use. However, if I keep failing classes and having to use my savings/ fafsa loans to pay off them I wont be able to get my own vehicle and I will rack up more debt. I dont even know what I want to do after college. Ive had a few ideas, but I dont think any of them really fit me. At first I wanted to do interior design but Im not really sure how to get in to it, then I thought about doing architecture and backed out of doing more research on it. I finally decided on dental hygiene but now I am having second thoughts since I cant even pass my basic biology 101 class. Ive tried talking to my family about my struggles but Im getting so tired of trying to explain a struggle to people that have never experienced or understand it. My mother was a good student and my sister thats currently in highschool is also the same. Now my mom is a RN and my sister is on track to going to school with a scholarship and an actual understanding of college. Both of them have asked me the question is dental hygiene really for you if you cant even pass bio 101 and it really upset me. Adding on, I dont talk to my brother about my struggles often but he is also doing better off in his college classes than me without putting in nearly as much effort as I do. He also has a car despite being younger than me. So yeah, I dont really know what to do. I like writing, but as you can see Im not very good at it. I have a couple hobbies, but Im not really good at any one thing in particular unlike the rest of my family members. I dont know why I cant relate to any of them and always find myself in this constant state of struggling. My sister recommended that I major in communications, but then when I asked her if it was a good idea she said that I was going to be replaced by ai and that my major wont matter much. I do like communications, however I have seen a lot of people say similar things about the major and how they regret taking it. I guess what Im trying to ask is what would you do in my situation? How can I make a come back from this? I dont want to be in community college anymore, I want to finally be able to live my own life and make my own decisions but I cant do that without passing this hurdle",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1jwiuc2/struggling_college_student_20f/,2

You're not broken. You're ahead of the curve. Friendship is overrated. No one wants to say it, but it's true. People aren't loyal. They're not kind. They're not thinking about you unless they need something. So why invest in that? Why chase people down just to get half-assed validation and shallow company? Be a lone wolf. Learn to like your own space. Embrace the silence. The sooner you get used to being alone, the better. Because outside of a romantic partnersomeone you build a life withmost relationships are either temporary, transactional, or both. You don't*need*friends. You might need connections. People who can help you land a job, open a door, get you in a roombut thats different. Thats business. Thats chess, not emotions. You play that game smart, with distance and purpose. The truth? Keep everyone at arm's length. Especially people who call themselves your friends. Dont invest your soul into platonic friendships especially when they are busy and don't have time to text you. Theyre not your family. Romantic love might be the only exception. Any relationship that's not romantic is meaningless.

I use to be the life of the party, the girl out every other weekend, talkative, up for hanging out, being around people etc. I noticed this past year or so, I dont want to do anything with friends. I dont care where its at, who its with , if I miss them or not but I just dont care to do anything. Even with family. I excluded myself from family things and find myself not wanting to be apart of anything. Now, with family and friends the people involved in my life have done me wrong in some way shape or form previously. So idk if my perception of them of I dont want to deal w the fake bullshit is making me feel that way of not being involved or what it is? There are some new friends in life that do invite me places but I honestly, dont want to go. They either want to go drinking or sit a bar and honestly after college Im not really into that. I dont think Im innocent in all parts as well, so maybe I am the reason sometimes why I dont leave my house. But recently like I said for the last year or so I dont feel myself at all.

He was 19 (only a year and a half difference and when we first started dating people thought I was his mom so definitely not like that) and at the time I didnt really have any close friends. ( a lot of my friend group dated my brother and the inevitable breakups would bleed into my friendships) When I was graduated, I attended community college for a semester before dropping out and going into ultrasound school. Thats when the pandemic hit. Everything was online and the people I met in school did not have much interest in maintaining a friendship after our classes were done. (Work and family life, everyone had kids and was about 5-10 years older than me) I am currently in a really stable career, my husband and I have a wonderful relationship, and a lot of things are feeling lovely. My husband and I eloped in 2019 and since then Ive been wanting to have a celebration. My cousins are all having lovely weddings and it makes me want to celebrate my love as well. But I had the realization, I have no friends. No one would stand on my side of the alter. My husband and I are very similar. We are home bodies, very small social batteries, and we tend to like more nerdy things. But he has at least 3 close friendships hes maintained since elementary school. Though I have spent time with his friends girlfriends, I dont think any of them actually consider me a friend. Ive thought about maybe bridging the gap to some old friends but I see all of them having really exciting lives with a lot of friends. I feel pretty pathetic, like I really have no friends.

I was scared of being alone. It's not a good reason to look for a partner, hell it's actually one of the worst in my own opinion. My desperation (calling it anything else would be untrue if I'm honest) led me down some dark paths that cost me a fair amount of money. Dating apps and unsavory sites included. And reflecting on all this made me realize something. I'm not ready to date. I have to get myself a bit figured out first. I call this melancholic because, yeah, a partner would be awsome right now; except that I'm an emotional wreck who would rely on them far too much. So, I think im gonna leave the dating scene for a while. Find myself some actual hobbies. Get a workout schedule in place. Re-learn how to enjoy life as it seems I forgot along the way.

This is not the first time he or my mother has said this even before I turned 18. I tell him what I said was ment to be a joke and how I was just being funny and wasnt being serious. He then says that he didnt give a shit and walked away so I go to my mom and asked her if she thought was being serious. She goes on and on about how Im disrespectful and how I need to make sure to do things when asked, I told her that I would do it but later due to the fact it was too windy to keep a flame going. She then goes on a rant about how shitty her life is and how me my father and my sister are too blame.

Im just really sad and feeling awful all the time. Its put me into a horrible state of derealization that I wish to break free from so badly but I just cant. I dont know what to even do and I just want to escape. Idk if its corrilated but it does also sometimes feel like it makes it hard for me to get a girlfriend in my life.

Back in 2020, I started watching some YouTubers, and they did what I can only describe as my dream. They did a sort of escape game? In the woods. And I, being a teenager and in lockdown, thought about how much I wanted to do it. So after a year of still consistently thinking about it, I looked up the website. And I was met with multiple issues. - I need a plural amount of friends (I had none) - I had to be 18+ - I had to be in good physical shape So I made friends, and I waited. And now Im 18, I feel like Ill never do it. Ill never have 4 or more friends, willing to go into the woods for a weekend with no water or electricity. Everyone is always so.. connected? I dont think this is a solitary thought. I think most of gen-Z feels this way. I just would really like to know how I could ..find people? Genuinely cool and interesting people ?

Anyways Ive had mixed experiences with friends, the terrible ones have done me so dirty bullied me and other traumatic experiences so Ive cut contact with them and the good ones seemed to have left to either move or live their life. Which I am happy for the good ones. I have graduated high school a couple of months ago and honestly its hard, it feels like people want to be friends but no one seems to make an effort and its all one sided. It feels like I know people but Im not really that close to anyone, like if they see me in public we will talk but other than that no one really cares all that much. Sometimes it feels like all I have is my partner who I have been with for almost three years. Dont get me wrong I love and appricate him, but I cant help but feel envious that he has friends and I dont. People keep telling me youll find your people one day but theyre only saying that because they have their people. They have close people in their life. It doesnt really feel like anyone understands and I know how childish that sounds but it really does feel like that. I live in a somewhat small town too, not too small where you know everyone but small enough that their isnt much to do other than go shopping, the movies and the beach and even that gets scarce. I work with some people I went to high school with but I dont really talk to them much when we do its nice but thats as far as it goes. I feel very out of place and kinda miss understood a lot I feel awkward, like theirs something wrong with me and that people are put off by my awkwardness. (By awkward I mean I might yap too much, get shy randomly, accidentally overshare nothing to major, my body language is closed off, I day dream randomly all the time, I ask too many questions and i apologise all the time even when its not needed.) Im really not sure what to do or how to even make friends as an adult. People make it so easy and I dont wanna just tag along with my bfs friends. Its not that I dont like them theyre lovely but I wanna have my own people too you know? But yeah if anyone has some advice on how they made friends after they left high school Id love to know. I would also like to mention I do a certificate online for my gap year and am about to do my placement this year if that helps with anything its for youth work tho so idk if Ill have time to make friends their maybe I do idk. I feel like I should have all these friends and experience by now because everyone else is out with friends, travelling, etc and I feel like Im still learning about myself because I never got to in high school and I am falling behind. But again if anyone has tips Id much appreciate it. I just worry I get to excited making new friends or that Im not good enough to be someones friend because Ive always felt like the backup friend or the therapist friend.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1joqpeu/making_friends_after_high_school/,2

youngadults,2025-03-31 04:50:57,"21 years old, on break from college, feeling like life is moving too fast","I just turned 21 last year, and Im a few months in dealing with so many feelings regarding my life moving way too fast. Kind of a big drop of info but my dad died of covid in 2022 when I was 17 (senior in highschool getting ready to graduate), and without any consideration for what I wanted to do (i wanted to be a doctor at the time, for all of the wrong reasons) I was pushed into college by my emotionally unavailable mom at the time. I was about two years in, when I got severely depressed, unable to get any course work done (even an easy major), without any direction nor motivation to finish anything in college. I left after many attempts to get my grades back up, and a breakup with an emotionally unavailable partner who left me with a lot of empty promises of intimacy and relationships. While at school living on my own, my roommate and I were also victims of a sexual harassment case, and had to navigate going to court on our own and testifying. Im back at home now after all of that mess at college, and have just been left a complete mess. Im no where near anywhere where I need to be in terms of adulthood, and Im scared I never will be. The outside world terrifies me after everything Ive been through, and now that Im back at home I have very little desire to live on my own ever again. I came back home, and now my mom is so much older than when I left, and my brothers are only getting older now too, and I know that I will someday have to say goodbye to the life I loved with them. I feel like all the love and support any young adult growing up was ripped so violently away from me, and while I did enjoy the growth and time I had at college as my own person, it did not come without the feelings of abandonment from what little I have left of my family and parents. Time feels like its moving too fast for me. I know that I am still so so young, and that not being at college alone is the BEST decision for my mental health, but Im so mad at myself for being so behind with everything. I was very loved and over sheltered/protected as a kid due to my parents having horrible and traumatizing childhoods as first generation immigrants, and Im just as terrified of anything adult. Im 21, and I feel like Im 17 again navigating the world. Except this time Im so so far behind. Everything that I thought Id be enjoying at this age isnt what I want, it all terrifies me. Im so behind developmentally I feel, in addition to the adhd diagnosis during adulthood. I guess Im writing this now because Im terrified not of the changes that I know will be happening with me, my life, my family, and the people I know and love going into my early 20s, but that Ill have no idea how to handle any of it. Life feels like one big kick in the ass for me, and its getting so hard to force myself to continue letting go of the childhood that was so so abruptly ended for me. I have no idea who I am, who Im supposed to be, and now Im just left with college debt, no degree, no desire to ever be independent again, and a terrifying fear of the world and everything that comes with it. If anyone has gone through anything similar, at all, please. Any words of reassurance and reminders to be patient with myself would mean the world to me right now. Im just so directionless and terrified of everything right now.

I feel its time for me to leave since my mom is in a better place right now, but she keeps doing anything she can to get me to stay, she cannot see how depressed and miserable I am, she thinks if I attempt to learn the language my life will be great. She can barely speak the language and her life isnt great she hates her job so Idk why she thinks this.

youngadults,2025-03-29 07:09:28,"Hi, stop chasing your dreams. (Let me explain)","So I've (F20) had two experiences with friends (M21 and M29) recently that really shifted my perspective on life goals and whatnot. One of them (M21) wants to stream. His plan was to stream, and work at Walmart while he did it. What he ended up doing was never streaming and is still working at Walmart, and constantly complains about how much he hates it. He recently started streaming after talking about it for years, and has quit his job at Walmart. He's living off of his father's income, which is limited to start with all in pursuit of being a famous streamer. The other (M29) wants to be an artist. He works a retail job he claims to despise that hurts him physically so much that he's bedridden after work for a few hours. He doodles instead of attempting to improve, and constantly rants to me about how much he lacks technique and structure and other artsy things I don't understand. Okay, so back to the title. Stop chasing your dreams recklessly. For friend 1, when he asked for my advice (because people don't like unsolicited advice), I told him he should absolutely start streaming, just make sure he has an income to fall back on. I've been supporting this idea for years. When he quit his job he asked my opinion, and I told him it was unwise. He could have KEPT WORKING and started streaming on the side. For friend 2, when he asked for my advice, I told him he could either a) go back to school and finish the 6 credits left to get his bachelor's in art, b) take classes online/practice technique productively/hire a private tutor, or c) find a full-time job that is less physically demanding that gives him the independence he very much seems to want. Or, a combination. Take classes part-time to complete your major and find a full-time position, stay at your job and take classes online, post content to gain an audience and keep WORKING on the side. Now here's me: My passion is music. I have been playing piano and singing for the past 15 years, and there is nothing I'd like more than to fully invest all my time into it. I wanted to perform and teach, and I'd invest every waking second into it if I had the means. But here's what I'm doing: I'm teaching piano part time while getting a degree in something more secure than piano performances. I'm practicing piano at home and taking lessons from the same teacher I've had for the past 7 years. I'm not playing in front of thousands, but I'm cultivating my interests enough to be satisfied. And mind you, I had to learn how to be satisfied with not being the best, or the most famous, or the world's most sought-after teacher. It took time, but I'm here now. Maybe I'll even start posting piano content one day, but my point is I'm getting my music fill. I'm cultivating my passion and setting myself up to succeed. I think one of the reasons that most if not all of my friends (and many college students) keep changing their majors over and over again is because they believe that the only way to enjoy an interest is to invest 100% of your time and energy into it. Thus, as hobbies and interests change, so do their goals and priorities. I get it, I changed my major once too. I guess the point I'm trying to make is you don't have to be fully, 100% invested in something to enjoy it. You're not any less of an artist, content creator, pianist, whatever just because life didn't hand you everything you needed to commit all your time to something. If anything, I really admire people (like my mom and her Spanish tutoring business that she started while working full time and raising me and my sister) that have the guts to find BALANCE. I went from practicing 6 hours a day to studying 6 hours a day. I practice less, but I just finished mastering Clair de Lune after a few months of slow but steady practice, and I could not feel more fulfilled than I do right now. Yeah, playing Clair de Lune at 3:00AM with no mistakes for the first time was absolutely, 100% the inspiration behind this. I'm really not trying to come off as insensitive, this is just one of those perspective shifts that helped me learn to love my passion again instead of resenting it or hating the world because I was given the short end of the stick financially. I love piano again even though I'm not performing in front of thousands. The only person that heard me play just now was my chameleon, and I'm so happy he heard me. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1jmgspa/hi_stop_chasing_your_dreams_let_me_explain/,4

In October I happened to get a nasty case of pneumonia and that caused me to quit smoking and weed entirely. Since then, Ive picked up on drinking and now drink 3-4 times a week. When I drink, I usually have 5-10 maybe even 12-15 drinks on a rough night. I got a good bit of Irish in me and my family likes to drink a lot too so idk if that plays a factor. I dont feel like drinking has had a significant impact on my life, especially since a lot of people my age drink a lot too, but the amount I drink does concern me, especially given the FDA guidelines. I do feel like I should cut down on how much I drink. But I dont want to quit entirely. Especially at this age everyone around me seems to drink.

youngadults,2025-03-25 01:13:36,20 and feel so behind,"20F and as much as I read other people's advice and reassurance, I don't think I'll ever not feel behind my peers at times. I'm turning 21 soon, and I have nothing to show for it. I've been depressed for a very long time to the point where it affects my daily life (health, hygiene, social life), though it has gotten much much better. I dropped out of online college the first semester out of high school, and the next school year, I completed an online program at a community college. Wasn't even interested in the program, I just did it so people would stop speaking badly of me. Now I work a part-time job. I don't nearly make enough to move out. I'm not interested in school, but I've forced myself to look for schools in the area. The motivation always goes away when I see that they're always far enough away that the commute would be ridiculous, but I am pushing myself to at least pass the knowledge test. And I feel that I'm not ready to live on a campus, though I'm aware that most people's advice is to force myself to go do it so I can get the ""experience."" *I know that.* The real problem is that I always find myself comparing my life to others. My peers are either working and making good money, or stable independently, or in school, close to graduating. And I'm working a part-time that doesn't even give me enough to live on my own. I always try to find a second job, but I'm only guaranteed two days off my main job, and no one wants to hire someone who can only work two days. And the job market is so bad that I can't even find a full-time job. I can logically understand that everyone moves at their own pace; I can tell this to other people to reassure myself and others, but there's always going to be times where I feel bad about myself. I can feel totally fine about living with my mom one day, but then someone will make a little comment and it completely ruins my mood. And to make things worse, I don't really have any hobbies anymore. I barely find anything enjoyable like I used to. I don't have a romantic life, and I have very few friends who still live in this area, but my social battery is just horrible that I find myself struggling to even hang out with people. So now I spend most of my time doing almost nothing when I'm not working. I don't want to be seen as a bum or something, but I feel like my options are so limited because I just want to be happy in life. I don't want to do something I don't want to do; if I work, I'd like to do something I enjoy. If I go to school, I want to study something I enjoy. But that outlook has made people think I'm a bum or something, and as much as I don't want to, I care what people think especially when they're saying it out loud. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone is feeling the same way. I don't really want to be told what I should do, and I don't want to hear things I've heard before. I already know what I should do to get out of this ""slump."" I'm posting here because I simply want to know that I'm not alone in feeling this way because I feel that it could possibly give me some motivation, even if it takes a while. TLDR; I'm not in school, don't have a degree, and working a part-time with no sign of moving out in the future.

I still live at home and with a very opinionated mother, and I have my 2 younger siblings. I feel like I catch myself saying I need to ask my mom a lot more than the typical 21/22 year old. And certain things I find others can do freely is somewhat restricted to me. Then I have a lot of responsibility in my siblings lives (which I get being an older sibling, it just gets to the point of but this isnt my child, why am I in charge of getting them to bed and what not somethings I do just feel more parental) Even dating feels difficult. I feel as if Im 16 lol. I need to ask to go out and stay out past around 8pm. Sleeping over a friends house is practically forbidden. Even when I moved out for a bit, my mother had my location (which I didnt mind for safety reasons) but was still controlling my life. Simply taking out a credit card is hard. She doesnt want me to, and I think since Ive abided by her decisions/rules for so long it makes it hard to do as I please. I recently got a tattoo without her knowing (I was legal age) and she absolutely flipped and made me feel horrible for not asking for her permission to tattoo my own body lol. (This goes in hand as to why taking out a credit card on my own is difficult because shell make me feel like Im disrespecting her opinion) I just feel as if Im not an adult lol, at least not compared to most other people Ive met around my age.

Lately, Ive been reflecting on my childhood and high school years, and its confusing. I actually enjoy my adulthood morehaving independence and not minding responsibilities. Still, I can't shake the feeling that I miss something from my past, even though I know my childhood wasnt ideal, and high school was pretty isolating for me. I often walked the halls alone, watching others socialize, which made me realize how much that isolation has affected me now at 24. I live alone now and spend a lot of time relaxing on video games, computer, or watching TV, which I'll admit can get boring sometimes. Financially, Ive been living off disability checks after a life-changing financial event, in which Ive saved several thousands of dollars from disability backpay I didnt know I had all these year. While it was a much needed safety net for me, but I feel like Im at a crossroads in life. I had a dream of becoming a sports statistician, but I hit some financial walls with my online college, and my transcript is being withheld over a debt. I sometimes feel like Im just drifting into the unknown at a crossroads, with so many possibilities but also a lot of fear. What really hits me is the realization that I never really got to enjoy high school. Sure, it was tough, and most of the kids were cruel to me, but I wonder if I missed out on connections and experiences that couldve shaped me differently. I had plenty of wide open chances to date and connect, but my social anxiety from my autism held me back, and now I regret not taking those shots when I had the chance to. I guess Im just trying to figure out what I truly miss, if anything, and how to move forward from here.

youngadults,2025-03-16 03:50:43,Friends boyfriend does not want her to be friends with me,"to give background, I am a 20 year-old female and so is my friend we have been friends since fourth grade. Her and her boyfriend have been together since we were in high school when we were 16 years old. throughout the relationship, he has kissed another girl a few years ago, and he cheated on her last December. Multiple times throughout the relationship he has proven to be controlling and very insecure. He has made comments about what she wears saying that she only wears certain outfits to attract other mens attention. her and I had a very rocky friendship in the middle of high school but in the last three years, things have been much better and our friendship has been the best that its ever been. In the last week Ive been sending her text messages, but she hasnt responded when I asked her yesterday if we were going to go on our hike today that we planned last week she said that she cant. I didnt think too much of it, but I did think it was a little bit odd considering that we had made the plan of previous week and she acted like I was just asking her right then in there. She then starts texting me on Snapchat asking me about what I think about her boyfriend and what I thought about him when they first started dating and what I think about him now. I thought it was a little bit odd for her to ask me these things and I kind of assumed that it was him texting as her so I asked for a picture proof and she sent me a video of her talking and it was really her. The conversation then goes into her saying that she really shouldnt be talking to me and I asked why she had said that he didnt want her to be friends with me anymore and thought that I was a bad influence. He is basing this off of earlier in the week I had joked around from watching TikTok saying hey we should join a friend finder app so we can make a friend group because we are always joking about how its just her and I we have no other friends other than each other. when I said that I obviously meant girlfriends because we are both in a relationship, I have been in my relationship for almost 5 years now as well. Throughout our friendship, I have never mentioned or thought about cheating on my partner. he took that as I was trying to tell her or influence her to cheat on him when I clearly made it clear in the message that it would only be female friends and also it was just a funny thought. She also mentioned that he is always bringing up the past in our friendship, which has not been the case for us for the last three years. He also tells her that he thinks that I hate him because of all the stuff that she tells him about him. When I only give her my opinions when she tells me stuff other than that I always try to be supportive because I know that she loves him. So I never give her my opinion or tell her to leave him or anything like that just out the blue. I feel like he is doing this based off his own insecurities and wants to be controlling and doesnt want her to have friends. In the almost 5 years that theyve been together, we never have once all gotten together to hang out he in fact has never actually met me in person besides the times that we have cross paths in high school, but we never spoke to each other. There has been multiple times throughout the years that I have tried to make plans to have a double date so we can all get to know each other, regardless of the things that I know that hes done to her I still try to make an effort to be supportive of her. When we were texting this evening and once she told me that he didnt want us to be friends anymore I called her. I told her that she cant let him control her and she says that she understands and she wants to be my friend. But when were having this conversation and Im telling her she just needs to stay in her ground, she says that she has but she was still avoiding me the whole week but she also isnt giving me a clear line of what shes doing. Its like she wants to be friends with me still but she wants to hide our friendship. A part of me feels like staying because obviously I care about her. Weve been such good friends for a long time and I know this isnt directly her fault. But on the other hand, I also feel like this isnt fair to me and I shouldnt have to put up with this . This guy is literally making me sound like a horrible person and painting an image of me and his head and running with it. I really dont know what to do. I feel like I should just walk away or just let things be but then the other part of me really doesnt want to walk away because we have been good friends for such a long time. And even after all this I even mentioned to her that maybe we should all just hang out so maybe he can actually meet me and get to know me as a person instead of making up all these things about me and creating opinion of me based on his own thoughts, but I also feel like what good can that do because regardless hes going to make his own opinion of me. She also mentioned that he said that if we all got together, I would just make faces and be rude to him, which is not true at all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1jcd0et/friends_boyfriend_does_not_want_her_to_be_friends/,1

youngadults,2025-03-15 18:58:10,Confusing friendship,"So I have a guy friend of 6 years. Im not necessarily holding off my dating for him BUT if he were to confess that he liked me Id be all in lol. My thing is, I cant necessarily tell where our friendship is going. Simply because were SUPER close, and I get scared that if he were to date someone Id be cut off due to our closeness. (Which if it were to happen I would 100% respect) I know everything about him, we speak on the phone for HOURS and have watched practically every movie and show together. Like either me or him would see something that looks good and we wont watch till the other is free and we watch together. Since we were friends from I was a bit younger, a lot of what I learned that I liked in a man, I got from him and either his actions, or character/personality. He currently is not dating, he says that hes just focused on work and reaching a level to comfortably get married and just live life. He does still live at home (were young so its not a red flag for me lol. 22&24) I just cant tell if hes just holding onto me for like the company or if something more is that I know its a dumb question to ask at my age but its confusing because other guy friends I have all ways tell me that a guy will not be friends with a woman they find attractive unless they have greater intentions and I know he finds me attractive (NOT IN A COCKY WAY LOL, he confessed that to a friend and she ended up telling me) Side note, we live in 2 separate states though I have plans of moving back to his current state. Not for him ofc, I used to live there so its home. Funny enough, we found out that for a vast majority of our lives we lived like 5 minutes from eachother, took the same bus and everything, so theres like an 80% chance that weve passed each other before we actually knew each other which was kinda cool lol",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1jc2bxl/confusing_friendship/,1

So what can I do? I'll just be coy about my age for now and just not tell others how old I really am.

youngadults,2025-03-15 05:38:58,I'm not sure how to give this thing a title but listen-,"Hiiii, I'm a 19F, this is my 1st year of college, and for context I've been to only girls' school for my whole life and now I'm in a co-ed college. So it started I guess 6 months ago, I started talking to this guy in my class, he's funny and cute, not to mention that I like tall guys but he isn't tall.......yeah......but I kinda liked him, but I suppressed my feelings as I knew there's something going on b/w him and this other girl in our class, but she got her addmission in another course so she left and he started talking to me, for hours, and that too....... intimate and kind of sexual, but it was kinda like flirting and stuff, I'd give him that, I often asked him about that girl but he said that they're not dating and nothing is going on b/w them. But then I made a mistake and told one of our mutual friends (that girl's and mine) and she asked me if something is up, and I told her too that yeah, but the tables turned against me and they both went out together and I was left alone. Honestly , I fell for him, hard, but I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't stop my heart to not like him, it just grew more and more. But they broke up in a month or something. Since me and that guy were in the same class, we had to communicate, but now our friends started dating (like my friend and his friend) and they asked both of us to accompany them, so we did. Again we landed to square 1 and the flirting started again, I took it casually, but I was enjoying it, again, but I still kept my distance, then we had this vocation thing for 20 days. We talked online and stuff, I kinda challenged him that he won't do anything he says as he is a coward and stuff but when we met he did, like it was rubbing my thighs at a cafe, while we accompanied our love birds, but then it slowly grew and I got greedy, I told him that I know u don't wanna be in a relationship but what we're doing is also unsettling so either be in a relationship or be fwb (I know that's totally dumb, but I was kinda desperate for him, kinda love him too much that I can do anything) He said he doesn't trust me for not telling anyone else like I did before, I told him to trust me, but he said he'll think over it and kinda, ignored me, I respected that and didn't asked again. One day, the love birds decided to go watch a movie with us, but my friend was too sick that day so they insisted me and this guy to go alone, and so we did, in the cenima we were watching the movie but were really bored as the movie was REALLY shitty, so he turned towards me and asked if he can trust me and I said yes u can, and then he kissed me and we started making out, that happened that day and then again he said that he is kinda scared of this and that he likes someone else (idk if it's a lie but ig he do like someone but who, idk) We again started not talking and stuff, like I avoided going with the love birds as he did too. Two weeks back I went to the place where these love birds go and spend time together, it's a paying guest house, and this guy was there too. The plan was again for us to watch a movie or something and them to spend time together. We awkwardly did tried doing that. When we were left alone, there were two chairs kept, one that was totally normal, I was sitting on it, and the other that didn't had the seat and he was sitting on it, we watched the movie for a little while when the internet crashed and we couldn't watch the movie, so I started scrolling through my phone (his was on charging) He told me to get up as he was sitting too uncomfortablly, so I glared at him and stood up, leaning against the wall. Ok, TMI, I was wearing a black baby tee and jeans, the baby tee length was till the waist band of the jeans (I hope u get it, it wasn't that sexual or something). He pulled me on his lap saying can't let the lady standing, I told him not to but gave in, for a good while we were like that and I kept talking as I'm kinda yapper. And he again tried pulling me into a kiss, saying in or not? And I was like, man u sure t?? And he again said in or not? And we makeout again, this time I didn't let him in my pants ( yk like last time he fingered me but this time I didn't let him, but he did sucked on my tits) we did that for an hour, I'm not going into details but I'll tell u it was really good and kinda cute, I told my other friend and she said if u guys were in a relationship, the things that happened were really cute. Another TMI, we were doing all this on the rooftop, and I did gave him a bj since I already gave him at the cinema and idk what to do with that thing. Anyways, after that thing we again grew apart and now I'm kind of missing him, I'm longing for him, missing his talks and everything, his touch even though it wasn't pure I'm sure but I miss it, I know, my friend told me that this is totally wrong but I'm too much dripped with love, I'm literally just nuts over this guy, honestly I'd say, I've loved once and I'd love only once. As someone who is scared of guys since I never interacted with any, I let him touch me and do things, solely because I love him. My friend is telling me to hate him, since he just doesn't treat me well and is using me for his lust.......I mean u think idk that? I'm just.......too much dearly in love that I can't find any reason to hate him, even though i know WE are wrong. I just blame myself for everything, this all is my fault, I'm his temptation and seduction. I'm the wrong one here, everywhere. I cry everyday for this, since the lent days are going I'm fasting for my mom, my brother, my dad (he passed away last year) and this guy, like specially, and ofcourse my friends. I fast for them, I ask God to do his magic and miracle to make us one, if that's his choice. But yesterday that girl, one of the love birds, she told me that there are rumours going around the class about me and this guy, and they're not very pleasant, she told me to maintain distance from him and stuff, I told her I'm not talking to him or anything, but she said, listen I'm observing u quietly, u still look at him with those longing eyes and the love that's dripping down from those eyes is very obvious. Tmi again, a few days ago was our annual sports meet, so me and a group and our classmates (including that guy) were playing flip the bottle. So this love bird girlie told me to not include myself even if it's a group thing like this, remove him, his friends and prolly anyone who is associated with him from everywhere. I was sad, and upset that I have to REALLY do THIS? I did. I removed him from everywhere, I cried afterwards for a long while, and today in the morning I threw up badly, now I'm just having a migraine headache and lost my appetite. Idk what to do, I like him a lot, everyday I'm starting to love him more and more, songs remind me of him, can't focus on anything else, I don't wanna lose him, but he is not even my...... anything.......I love him so much that I hate myself for doing things we did in the past and......it hurting. Idk it's just giving me more headache.

I try to stay out of drama, but Im always glad to gossip if they want to. If They tell me theyre not comfortable with something Ill stop. But when they stop talking to me, the answer is always. You should know what youre doing wrong. Why cant you just tell me?? I was homeschooled in high school so Im not really good at this socializing stuff. Im also autistic and have ADHD. Got to the point where now Im afraid to speak to anyone. Is there something Im saying thats throwing people off?

youngadults,2025-03-14 19:36:22,My step(dad) is driving me away and I feel stuck and hopeless,"I hope this isn't long, I'm sorry if it is im just so frazzled right now and also kind of just frazzled in general lately. I'm not even entirely sure where to post this but I'm here now so. Ok so my dad is 71M and I'm 25F. I'm also about 5 months or 22 weeks pregnant with my first ever child. I currently live with my mom and my dad out in the country where it's like 30 minutes minimum to drive into any given city around us. (Their choice, not mine.) I have a boyfriend 25M who lives in the city about 40 minutes northeast of where I live. I also go to work in that city too. We're planning on getting an apartment together (hopefully) before our son is born. Not sure that will happen since money is kind of tight all around and the apartments out in that area are upwards of $1200/month. My whole reason for this post is this. My dad is obviously older now and has been kinda diagnosed/not exactly diagnosed with alzheimers. It's so confusing, but he definitely has the symptoms of it so we kind of just say he has early alzheimers or whatever. He's gotten so mean/crabby/grumpy over the years and it's really hard to deal with. He says whatever is on his mind with no filter and doesn't seem to understand when it upsets others. I want to feel bad for him and of course I love him dearly but him constantly spouting mean shit is wearing me down. He doesn't like my boyfriend because he believes he's not trying hard enough. I don't tend to agree with that, i believe he's trying the best he can for the situation we're in. So of course when my dad upsets me, I go to my boyfriend to vent, that has led my boyfriend to also not like my dad. So lots of tension has been created. I live with my parents and don't have to pay rent so thats really nice, but it would also be AMAZING to be able to be living independently with my boyfriend and our soon to be born son especially since my dad is being a jackass. I just feel so stuck because I can't stay with my boyfriend where he lives currently as there is not enough room and I do have my own dog who is not friendly with other dogs or people really. So if for some crazy reason I did try to stay with him in his current situation, i wouldn't be able to bring my dog and that would piss not only my dad off but also my mom as they would say I'm abandoning her. I see their point and I don't want to just leave her, but my dad is so fucking hostile it hurts my heart so bad. I don't know what I can even do besides being strong and setting the goal of getting the apartment ASAP. It sucks so bad to have to hear all of that from my dad because yes he's always not had a filter but it's definitely gotten 10x worse over the years. I dont like being around him much anymore and that breaks my heart because I believe family is family and you're always there for family. If anyone has been in a similar situation or maybe has some advice or insight or LITERALLY ANYTHING, i would greatly appreciate it. I feel so upset and lost and I was having such a good day before my dad said something completely uncalled for when I got home from the grocery store. Thank you for reading this far if you did. TL;DR- my stepdad is grouchy as fuck as he's gotten older and is saying really mean shit to me and about my boyfriend and its making me resent him a lot. I feel stuck in my current situation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1jbc95b/my_stepdad_is_driving_me_away_and_i_feel_stuck/,3

I want him to be at my wedding, but at this point he probably wont be. I do not want to rush marriage just so he can be there, but my boyfriend and I are maybe thinking of getting engaged in like a few months? It would be a long engagement, Im not sure how long just depending on how long my dad actually has. If some clinical trial magically works for a couple more years then great Ill say lets get married, but if he passes before then I would want to wait a few years because it would be really painful to do it without him I do want my dad to at least be there for my engagement, but I dont know if its crazy. Everyone Ive asked said my plan is valid since its very important to me to not rush marriage. Everyone in my family has gotten married very young and only one has ended in divorce, so I just may not have the best perspective for this because I know its rare for it to work out when youre young. The people Ive asked outside my family have said the same as my family though, so I guess I want more outside perspective. I know people change a lot in their 20s, so you dont have to say that lol.

youngadults,2025-03-14 01:54:01,"March 13th, 2020 was 5 years ago, and it feels like none of the 5 years since have felt real or lived-in.","I dont even know how to start with this. I was 16 and in 11th grader in HS when COVID was announced that Friday and when the subsequent pandemic, lockdowns and all of restrictions happened. Im 21-22, now and I have been looking back at the five years since and I feel like it none of those five years have felt real, or lived-in, it all just feels like a blur of sporadic memories, moments, and experiences. It doesnt help that when schooling went virtual, it stayed virtual until graduating over a year later in 2021. I never saw or spoke with any of my classmates in my graduating year again after that, until that brief moment where we graduated 15 months later. I feel like I havent changed as a person since 2020. I feel like Im that same 16-18 year old, just more jaded and more hollowed-out and shelled-shock. I havent experienced any significant growth, progress, or milestones since 2020 outside of maybe the first 6-12 months after graduating HS and turning 18 in 2021. Ive been in community college since 2021, and have not even made it past the halfway point of progress for my degree. Meanwhile, peers in my class are supposed to be graduating this year. Many peers that I see on social media who were in the same graduating class as I seem to at least be different people than the people they were in HS, living different lives, with a sense of goals, relationships, careers, etc. I, on the other hand, feel like Ive never been able to grow out of the person that I was 5-10 years ago, during HS and during COVID, and that the last 5 years have meant so little, and I was already in a bad place at 16. I know, comparison is the theft of joy, but it feels like Im stuck in the step that I have been in years, unable to move on to the next step, while everyone and everything in the world is changing around me. It feels weird because I often look at myself at 16-18, both before and during COVID, and feel a deep sense of longing despite it being a traumatic time for me. Because it feels like I was less jaded, less hollowed-out, less shell-shocked, and overall feeling like Ive still had all of these years of college, young adulthood, and my twenties and the rest of my teens ahead of me. I remember feeling like my life sucked as a high schooler, and the isolation that the pandemic/lockdown caused didnt help, but at least I was a lot more innocent then, and I had a lot to look forward to in life, where now it feels like Im starting to feel like Im destined to be a loser in life. Those final months before March 13th was the last time I felt like I was living my life, and felt like I was in a set path and timeline, and nothing since has felt real to me. Its as if that entire five year period from March 13th, 2020 to 2025 has been nothing but derealization and disassociation, and I dont know if its going to continue to be like that. It sucks, and I dont know how to process the fact that the last 5 years since have meant nothing to me, and that I feel as if it was all wasted.

We're foreign nationals living in a country where there's no govt. benefits for foreign nationals and citizenship/PR doesn't exist. Recently they've started becoming more and more hostile towards me, to the point of ignoring my existence and humanity. Not cooking dinner, not turning the lights off for just an hour so I sleep(we live in a studio, mom does wfh), not even putting my phone on charge if I forget(even roommates have the decency for that). All this because she had to help with half of my car's purchase(beater, nothing fancy) which I'm apparently not worthy of. The final straw came today when I was blamed for misplacing bank details, yelled at the whole day, complained to relatives and even told that I would've been better off dead. Keep in mind I pay the rent. Now I have zero idea how to survive on my own, I can't take care of my own health properly, I take antidepressants and I'm short tempered. If I do move out, I'll have to make my own visa( self-sponsored visa is a huge expense, if you're self employed like me), live in shared dorms and have zero support network and being a single male I would lose access to a lot of things.

Maxed out on every trait I wanted to have. Everything pretty in me is maxed out pretty in her, plus other features I dont even have and have always wanted. Shes just perfect. And I feel I cant compete. Im just boring and like one colour while shes a whole palette of bright fun colours. Weird analogy I know. I could go on and on about her. I have no clue why my bf is with me when SHES there. I also feel this might end up sabotaging our relationship :/ Shes just better in every way. Shes on her way to be successful, while I have nothing going on in my life. And I dont even feel like starting because theres no point, Im just running for the sake of it.

So my birthday was a little while ago, it was my 20th and honestly I was pretty damn depressed for it. Didn't have a lot of friends to celebrate with and was basically alone, and it felt(still feels) really weird not being a 'kid' anymore. I decided to treat myself to a beach day, both to go romp around and also cause I needed some driftwood for an aquarium I was setting up. I have no car though, so had to take the bus to get up which had a very inconvenient schedule. So I got to the beach, found some sticks and got so distracted that I unfortunately missed the bus pick up. Now there was another bus coming in a couple hours, and I could always call a ride too if needed. So I decided that, now that I was here for at least a couple hours, I might as well do some more exploring. This particular beach stretched for 3 miles north up to another beach, where on the other side there was a small resturant. I was pretty hungry at this point, so thought it'd be fun to walk up there and catch bus later that evening at that spot instead. So I cruised up the beach, and got some really great views of the clouds and sinking sun along the way. I eventually got to the cutoff to where the other beach started; however, while the map only portrayed a small stream separating them, by now the ride had come in and that tiny stream was basically a river. After scouring the area for a bridge or easier way across, I stupidly chose to wade through a shallower point, which worked and I made it to the other side of the beach, soggy but triumphant. I had no change of clothes in my pack. So after drying off a tiny bit I walked up to the resturant, and when I got inside I realized this wasn't just some little beach shack, it was a full on fancy ass resturant. My belly was roaring though, so I decided to give it a try. I asked for outdoor seating for obvious reasons, and was really surprised to see them setting the table with fancy cloths and a bunch of different forks and silverware and shit. I ordered crabcakes and some jumbo shrimp which were the cheapest things there, but combined still cost a whopping $70. They eventually bring out two tiny, barely palm sized, pencil-thin crab patties and 5 individual finger length shrimp, both elaborately decorated in the middle of these giant white plates. For the cost of it all I was half convinced I'd be able to keep the plates too. I kept getting odd looks from the other diners, who were almost all either in pairs or groups. I was the only lone person there. Not to mention still pretty soggy, dressed like a casual vagabond and with my backpack as my only companion in the opposite chair. Yeah, I stuck out like a giddamned giraffe in a horse ranch. Eventually I finished up and caught the bus back home, where I promptly went to sleep.

And Im trying really hard to unlearn it, so my best method of practice is to not respond at times, or to end a conversation before I get to a breaking point. All my life Ive been around women. Ive been called gay (which isnt 50% incorrect) and many other things as well because of this. So what Ive learned even as a kid sometimes exhibits women behavior that Im trying to control.

About a year ago, I went through a really nasty break up and was really beaten up about it for the longest time. My mom was there for me through it all and helped me keep my head up. It was because of her I was able to focus on my job and overall bettering myself. I got into a new relationship about four months ago with a really amazing girl. She makes me extremely happy and things have been going well! She has a good relationship with my family as I do with hers as well. We spend as much time together as we can as we really enjoy each others company. The only problem is, my mom isnt a huge fan of how much Im outside of the house. I work 40 hours a week and usually see my girlfriend around 3-4 days a week. We like being out of the house, going on dates, road trips, etc. For some reason though, my mom is constantly giving me a hard time about not being home or getting home late throughout these times. Its become really stressful on me as I am an adult and I dont think its fair to be super controlling on the things I do in my free time. I try to be home as much as i can, as well as bring my girlfriend over from time to time as well. This just doesnt seem enough for my mom though, and I just dont know what to do about it anymore.

TLDR: 19 yo, 32 grand saved up, working part time $18 an hour soon to be $19, in LA county. I'm 19, have little to no support and in an abusive situation. I have 32,000 saved up (most is from compensation for an accident.) I started my job in November and since then have made about 5,500 (included in the 32,000.) I average 95 work hours a month minimum, usually around 100, and make $18 an hour with a feasible opportunity to make 19 and hour soon, and at some point 20. I pickup shifts whenever I can, have very open availability, basically just focusing on work. Unfortunately I'm not in school right now and don't know how I'd afford college. I'd very much like to get a second job. I do art commissions to make extra money and am trying to start Uber Eats. I don't need to pay for car insurance/gas cause I'm a cyclist. I don't have a credit card or score, though I have records of paying my $27 a month phone bill on time, yes I need to find a cheaper one. I have super organized all my stuff and it can be easily moved in a day via small uhaul, only a couple large furniture items. I don't think a roommate would be possible as I couldn't live with a stranger even if I was ok with it and likely don't have any friends that would be able to room.

I'm cool with being a lone wolf. I've never really had any friends. I was homeschooled and did online school, and during online school, I made only one friend. She was a girl. She texted me every day, told me she loved me out of the blue, named her puppy after me, called me her best friend, etc. But after I graduated, I ghosted her (yes, I know our falling out was my fault). When I try to text her, she only gives one-word answers and never texts me back. She has a boyfriend who went into the Marines and a new BFF (who's a girl). Because of this, I don't want friends. And even if I did make ""friends,"" I have such a high standard for a friend that most people wouldnt be my friendthey would be acquaintances at best. The girl I met during school was a real friend. Anyone who doesn't do that isn't my friend. It doesn't matter if I know you for a year or twoyou are not a friend; you are just ""some person I know."" And I can't love them back. I just don't love acquaintances. The only person I can consider a friend is my ""best friend,"" and I don't have a best friend and probably never will. So anyone I meet and hang out with is an acquaintance at best. Also, I'd want a female best friend, not a male best friend, so I would never accept guys as my friends anyway.

youngadults,2025-02-11 23:21:32,How To Be Cool (advice for guys),"These are things I've learned from my own personal experience, so I wanted to share them. 1. Change your appearance Okay, I wanted to get this one out of the way, but if you are objectively ugly, there is no hope for you (unless, of course, you are rich). But if you aren't rich, there is no hope for youyou will be alone forever, so stop trying. However, if you are average-looking, there are things you can do to boost your appearance and aura, like going to the gym and building muscle. If you are fat, no girl is going to want anything to do with you, so go to the gym and get in shape. Shave, get a haircut, fix your teeth, and if you havent had a glow-up by then, get plastic surgery. 2. Don't go up talk to women Please don't go up and ""shoot your shot."" Leave women alone. If a woman is attracted to you and wants to talk to you, then she will go up and talk to you. 3. Don't ask women for their number or contact information and don't give your contact information out If a woman does come up and talk to you, don't ask her for her number or contact information. If you do want to contact her, ask for her Snapchat, Instagram, or emailall of those are less creepy than asking a stranger for their number. Also, don't give a woman or anyone your phone number. If someone wants to contact you, give them your Instagram. 4. If you are a nerd hide those hobbies Everyone has secret hobbies or interests. If you are a hardcore nerd who loves anime, Marvel, DC, sci-fi, etc., then keep those hobbies to yourself and find other, ""cooler"" hobbies that a woman will think are attractive. All that nerdy stuff will turn a woman off, and she won't want to talk to you. Video games are okay, but it depends on the gamefor example,*Call of Duty*is a ""cool"" game. I suggest you find other, cooler hobbies and interests, and if she asks what you're into, talk about those. Don't ever bring up the nerdy stuff. If you're at a theater and see a Marvel trailer, dont look excitedmaybe even roll your eyes at it. 5. Get a sports car If you want oneme personally, a sports car has always been my dream carso I saved up enough money to buy an older sports car when I was like 21. I'm not saying to buy a new, expensive sports car, but an older, used sports car is a realistic goal, and it will just make you come off as cooler. 6. People are not your friends! Learn the definition of friends My advice isnt just exclusive to datingits for socializing and making ""friends."" From my experience, people overuse the word ""friend"" too loosely. You have to differentiate between a colleague, an acquaintance, someone you just met once, and a friend. ""Friend"" is a strong-ass word, and people use it extremely loosely. Just because youve been talking and hanging out for five months doesnt make them your friendthey are your acquaintance at best. Friends text each other every single day. If your ""friend"" doesnt text you every day, they are not your friendthey just arent. Also, when you meet people, shake their hand. Never, ever hug anyone. Except your romantic partner and maybe you BFF. 7. Don't follow people Don't be the person who friends and follows people on social media. Let your acquaintances follow you, but don't follow them or anyone. You don't followyou have followers. 8. Fashion Change If you are a guy, look up cool fashion aesthetics on Pinterest and TikTok. 9. Brood and establish boundaries Be brooding, cold, and emotionally distant. Dont be rude, but be distant. Establish extreme boundaries with people. Be serious and chill; dont joke around and laugh. You arent Michelangelo from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Dont say ""I love you"" to anyone, and definitely dont say ""I love you"" to a ""friend"" unless they are your best friend that youve known for years upon years upon years. Overall, be stoic. Before anyone downvotes, these are all just MY PERSONAL OPINION. You dont have to agree with me, but you do have to respect my opinions.

Perhaps it is that Valentine's day just around the corner. I find myself weeping silently as I wipe off my tears, hating myself for being such a failure. I never experienced romantic love, while I saw many of my peers get into a relationship and even helping a few people get together, I've never experienced it myself. That got me into a cycle of feeling inadequate, self-hating and lonely depressive episodes. I realized: I needed to work on myself to be a better option. Even after working on myself, I still couldn't find enough courage to commit to a relationship for the fear of being rejected. People are not obligated to give me a chance even if I get better. Eventually I realized: I do not want to get into a relationship. Instead, I want an answer to feeling so lonely. I want to be validated, I want to feel loved and someone to love. I do not fear growing old, I fear growing old without experiencing love. I need to sort these issues by myself. No-one will help me do this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Not just city but even just country suggestions will be great. For some help, I'll provide some of my key interests. I good nightlife is a must, I love my electronic music and a busy nightlife is something I love, a creative place. I enjoy photography, I've just gotten into djing and I would really enjoy that general, open thinking way of life if that makes sense? I love exploring and nature so that would be nice to have around, the beach, mountains etc. I would prefer the heat. I love the sun however I could accept a winter if the rest of the year or the location made up for it. I'm not particularly career focused yet as I'm still trying to figure out what my 'purpose' is. I know I want to help people in some way. I had the idea of trying to build a lifestyle brand that focuses on young people trying to find the balance of health and building but enjoying yourself along the way. Just an idea? So ideally somewhere, where I can put my energy into this and a place that will resonate with that. My choices for the Uk are Leeds and Manchester but nothing gives me the spark in the UK. I'm looking into the Gold Coast, Madrid, Barcelona, Malta, Cyprus etc etc. I may be talking stupid here but I've learned to not ignore when things aren't feeling right.

youngadults,2025-02-05 22:41:04,Am i intentionally being left out?,"Advice/Rant Im 19 and a trans guy, Ive had the same friend group since basically 10-11th grade and Im in college part time. Ive struggled with my mental health since 5th grade, so Im not the most socially skilled person ever, and have a lot of anxiety and suffered from depression. Its better now that Ive been on Wellbutrin, but meds can only do so much. I recognize that I might be doing this to myself. My main friend group consists of maybe 10 people, but a couple have gone back to college in other cities. My two main friends, S and C, i know from highschool are roomates and best friends, I hang out with my 2 other friends, J and L, at least once a week because we watch drag race together on Sundays. S is usually the person to tell me about when and where were going to hang out, but shes extremely busy for an 18 year old. Shes more mature, she has a job thats basically full time, she pays rent. Shes intimidating, but I love her since Ive known her for so long. A few weeks ago the main friend group went 30 minutes out to Ss girlfriends house. They were just crafting and stuff, but she called at like 7:30pm, after I had a full day of working on school and doing grocery orders. I was tired, and I didnt feel like driving, so I said no. This is where I think they left me out of an important conversation. Which last week they asked if I wanted to go with them on a trip 2 hours out of town to an 18+ drag bar. My mom is in a different state for the week so I couldnt just leave my siblings and my dad since Im the oldest kid, and I dont have the money to go either. That same day last week, S gave L a present. The same present S mentioned weeks before hand that she would give me. In front of my face. I didnt say anything because I felt like Id just sound weird and whiney. Im just frustrated. S has done this a bunch, but if I distance myself from them I literally have no one else, I feel like its somehow my fault for being distant anyways. Ive been trying so hard to be around more and be willing to hang out but Im never sure of when the group is free AND Im not apart of the group chat since my phone number doesnt allow me to (and no, we cant use social media). It doesnt help that my girlfriend lives in Australia, and Im in the USA, so I cant even rely on her to be around when were physically not together.

youngadults,2025-02-05 07:11:13,I'm so terrified of aging that it's ruining what's left of my youth,"I'm 25. I don't want to look old. I don't want to wake up in pain. I don't want to give up my hobbies. I don't want to look in the mirror and see my mother or father. I'm so unimaginably terrified of aging that I'm seriously planning on ending my life at 35, unless technology advances to the point where it can somehow prevent us from becoming elderly. I've seen old photos of my family members when they were around my age. They were beautiful and vibrant. Now they're all 40-60 and look one foot in the grave. My mom and dad are constantly complaining about pain. Every subreddit aimed at people 30+ is just full of complaints about health, lost looks, their mind going, friends drifting apart, failing relationships, and missed opportunities. I'm convinced dying young is a blessing. Living to be middle aged seems like hell, and it's making me stressed to the point where I can barely function. I'm so focused on critizing myself for not making the most of my very limited time that I keep forgetting to actually do something with my life. The fucked up thing is a huge part of it is apperance related. I like how I look now, mostly. I have a nice face. I saw what my mom looked like at my age, and it was just like me. I'm going to look like her when I'm older, and that's terrifying to me because I'm a shallow son of a bitch. I want to look cute and twinkish and wear cute shit. And yeah, I know no one is going to stop me, but I'll look fucking awful in it at 40+. And that doesn't even cover my attraction to others. What if I start dating someone and they lose their hair? I'm not attracted to balding guys. The fuck would I do then? I know if you really love someone appearances shouldn't matter, but still. I'm ""cute and quirky"" (I hate using terms like that but I'm not sure how else to get my point across) and my hobbies and autistic behaviors are socially more acceptable right now because I'm privileged to be young and have an innocent looking face. I can pull off being androgynous because I'm young. By the time I'm 30, I'll be just some middle aged, badly adjusted woman (no one is going to see me as a guy/non-binary person once I stop passing).

youngadults,2025-02-03 02:21:07,Expectations of others,"I am 20F, 3rd year college, many people were stunned by my beauty and by stunned I mean really head over heels. There will be no day at school that I am not complimented. I am also intelligent and get praised by my professors. I say this to give you a visualization of my aura. Thats why many people puts me on a pedestal, they always told me that I deserve to join a beauty pageant and for sure I will be the champion. At first, I really didnt think about it, but because thats what other people expected me to do, that ideas has been implanted on my mind. However, every time our college department will choose for a candidate on a pageant I am never chosen, hence resulting into a disappointment. If I really am that beautiful and intelligent, why an I not chosen? this question keeps popping up my mind. Another scenario is that we have an oral revalida and those students who excel will get the outstanding award. 5 of my classmates told me, I will get that award for sure because I always ace my performances. I wasnt expecting any award tho, I just want to give my best and offer up to God the rest. As the awarding ceremony goes by, every time the speaker will state the name I hear the whispers of my name, saying it will be me. I refuse to expect anything but because of the expectations, I am also hoping. But in the end I wasnt given an award at all. I keep questioning my self what did I do wrong? Now, thinking about all the scenario, I am definitely dimming my light because I think that I really am too shiny. What can I do so that I dont think Im too shiny for others? Because even the littlest most minimal thing that I do, they admire me. So my thoughts are if I will not be humble, I will be unstoppable.

Its an hour drive from my parents house so I moved to be closer to work. The only downside is that Im living on my own without my car. I got my drivers license earlier this year after 2 years of having a permit and practicing. However, my parents wont allow me to drive the car that I pay insurance for and is under my name. So, they make the drive everyday to take me to and from work, which is taxing on them and the car itself. Theyll pick me up and let me drive home as practice and but Im not sure when theyll really consider me ready- its been 2 years. My job requires some travel, so paying for car insurance and Lyft is getting really expensive for me. On top of that, getting groceries delivered or trips to the grocery store.

youngadults,2025-01-28 09:49:00,Creepy Classmate Wont Stop Bothering Me Am I Overreacting?,"I (21F) am doing my masters, and theres this guy (28M) in my class whos been making me really uncomfortable. He joined late, and since our roll numbers are near each other, he started reaching out to me for help. At first, I felt bad for him because he seemed like a loner and he always sits alone and stay alone, so I tried to be kind and assist him. But his behavior quickly became creepy. He would only call me late at night, around 10 or 10:30 PM, which already felt odd. Initially, hed repeatedly ask me not to tell anyone that we were talking because he was afraid our classmates would make fun of him. He said this 4-5 times in a single call. I reassured him that were all adults, and with only 28 students in the class, everyone gets along like a small family. Then after an exam, his calls got weirder. He kept asking me if the professor would show us our answer sheets. I told him I didnt know, but he called me 2-3 more times with the same question. Later, he started asking when classes would begin. I explained that any updates would be shared in the official group, but he kept calling and asking me the same thing over and over. One night, the conversation shifted. He started asking about my favorite movies, and when I gave vague answers, he began talking about himself. Suddenly, he asked if Id like to hang out. I told him Im not someone who likes going out (which is true), and I only go out 3-4 times a year. But he kept pressing me about *why* I dont like going out. Then, out of nowhere, he asked if Id go to a different city with him. I was completely shocked. Why would I travel to another city with someone I barely know, especially a classmate who rarely even attends class? I tried to politely decline, but he kept pushing. He then asked if Id at least go to a caf with him. I kept dodging the question, but then he suddenly said, in a weird and aggressive tone, YES OR NO? I was so disturbed that I just said, Well see, and ended the call. That whole conversation left me feeling anxious. After that, he kept calling at night about the same repetitive questions, like when classes would start, and when they finally did, he didnt even show up for two weeks. The last time we spoke, I told him I dont like taking calls and that he could ask anything in the unofficial group instead. He got defensive and told me I *should* pick up his calls. I explained that I dont even talk to my best friend that often (which is true), but he responded in this strange voice saying, You can pick up for me. I was firm and said no, and he sarcastically replied, Okay, madam, whatever you say. That was the last straw for me. I told him he couldnt talk to me like that. Since then, Ive been ignoring his calls and texts. I honestly feel so disturbed by all of this. Hes barely my classmate, and his behavior has been so inappropriate and persistent. The fact that he only calls late at night and pressures me to talk or meet up makes it even worse. Im not sure if Im overreacting, but I just needed to share this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1iby3at/creepy_classmate_wont_stop_bothering_me_am_i/,12
youngadults,2025-01-27 06:45:37,"26 and still havent had sex, i tried but couldnt go through with it, feeling so conflicted","First of all, I'm a throwaway account because I could be identified on my main, sorry for the lack of karma. Hi everyone, Im 26 and Ive been struggling with this weird mix of curiosity, fear, and insecurity about finally having sex for the first time. I know theres no right age or timeline, but honestly, the older I get, the more pressure I feel, mostly from myself, tbh. So, recently, I actually had the chance to finally take that step. It was with someone I kinda trust and feel comfortable with., we even started playing truth or dare at a motel (it means something different in my country, its purpose is for couples to have sex, rented for a couple hours) to break the ice (btw, a friend came with me at the start so I wouldnt feel too nervous being alone with him right away). During the game, he was in just his boxers, and I stayed fully dressed. Some of the dares made me touch him accidentally, like his penis, and while hed pretend it was no big deal, I know it was intentional, hes not exactly subtle lol. Anyway, I really thought I was ready, but when it came down to actually doing it, I just froze. I couldnt let myself get past that mental block, even though I wanted to. The only thing I managed to do was let him see one of my boobs and stimulate it for a bit (which didnt feel like much, honestly), but thats as far as it went. He was super sweet and understanding about it, and Im grateful for that. But now that Im home, Im feeling so conflicted. Im frustrated with myself for not going through with it, but at the same time, I know deep down I maybe wasnt 100% ready. I really want to know what sex feels like, both physically and emotionally, but my fears just took over in the moment. Ive explored my own body and I know what I like, but Im scared that with someone else itll feel awkward or underwhelming. Plus, being 26 doesnt help. Its hard not to feel like Im the only one my age who hasnt done it yet. I try to remind myself its not a race, but sometimes it really feels like Im behind or missing out. So, I guess my question is: how do I get past this fear and finally feel ready? Is it normal to be so conflicted when I know I want this? Has anyone else been in this situation and eventually felt okay about it? Thanks for reading all this. Id really appreciate any advice or stories youre willing to share, and also sorry if this isn't the place to talk about it",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1ib1z77/26_and_still_havent_had_sex_i_tried_but_couldnt/,1

Ive asked here before because I wanted to know the possible root issues of his friends clingyness bc its too much and how it can be resolved. Like Im really out here thinking the man is secretly in love with his friend or something cuz if thats the case i feel like that would be so toxic, but hes usually out with other girls so I guess I dont wanna assume. My friends boyfriends friend is single and his other friends have gfs and my friends bf is kinda his best friend but my friend overheard him whining to her bf on a few occasions about wanting to hang out with him instead. Hes also completely moved to their vicinity to be close by which made sense at first bc my friends bf met her in our town away from his home and they kinda went long distance before he pretty much moved here for months. I can get if that friend feels he has to make up lost time but hes very clingy and feels like he should always be around them.

youngadults,2025-01-24 00:48:55,Feel like I missed out on that late teens era.,"Im 21 now and have been thinking about my past time. I was thinking about the ages between 16-18, mostly 17 and I felt like I missed out on stuff. I mean at the time I felt okay but looking back a lot of it was me day dreaming or hanging with my friend imaging what could be, rather than actually hanging with anyone else. During 17, I hung out with my toxic ex friend who just like treated me poorly and pressured me to do weed and other stuff, but I declined as I was scared because my mum would have killed me. Anyway I was treated so poorly by her and her friends but I guess it was better than nothing at that time but looking back it was just me being bullied by her and her new drug friends for not doing them or because she was just awful to me anyway. Then I see someones post who is now 21 and from when they was 17, they posted a whole gang of them ( them, two girls, two guys) all in the woods together with a mini camp fire, taking drugs and having the time of their life. All of them are still good friends now and seem happy and like they can move past that time and focus on more adult things such as careers etc. However I guess I am kind of Jealous and wish that was me back then or I had ditched that friend and spent time with those people instead or something similar. I hate how I didnt do drugs back then and just did it when I was 17 and people didnt judge you for making mistakes as much, I was so stupid to listen to my mum like a loser.

youngadults,2025-01-17 16:05:08,How to come terms with the working adult life?,"Might sound like a stupid question but I really wanted to ask how people are supposed to cope with stepping into adulthood. I'm turning 20 soon, and I've been living separately with my sibling for the past 7 months, but It's been difficult to find a job. All the work experience I have is roughly 3-4 weeks as a receptionist for an indoors trampoline park. I decided to quit right after I moved together with my sibling, but I thought I could find a new job quickly. The main reason I quit was because of the working conditions that affected my mental health poorly, making me continously anxious even when I wasn't working. These past few months went by rather quickly and unfortunately I've been in and out of depressive episodes that only just started to get a bit better since december. I came across very few job opportunities, but I'm not sure why I subconsciously always find something that makes me reject them because they're not ideal to my likings, let that be because of the conditions or the wage. I don't know if it's because I got comfortable in this lifestyle being unemployed or because of my past negative experience, but for some reason I can't process that I'm gonna have to spend the rest of my life working that takes so much time from my personal life. Maybe because I had to move away from my parents so early on and not having that type of comfortability and having to pay the bills. I do feel bad for making my sibling take financial care of me, but I do tend to give back once I can save up enough money. So ultimately my question is how to get friendly with the idea of work making up so much of your life leaving you with little to no time and energy for your personal hobbies and things you love to do?",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1i3jp6t/how_to_come_terms_with_the_working_adult_life/,11

youngadults,2025-01-15 14:28:28,How to move forward in life?,"Hi everyone. I'm 19 years old. I took an industrial training course at Senai and completed a high school-integrated IT technical program at Senac. I'm currently studying Systems Analysis and Development (ADS) in an online college, but I feel stuck. It seems like any step I take will lead me to regret it. I've always wanted to work with art because I love creating music in FL Studio, writing stories, composing, editing videos, and producing content. I know that if I really put my mind to it, I could succeed in this area, but it feels like such a gamble. Right now, I work from 7 AM to 5 PM operating a CNC machine. This job takes up all my time, leaving me with no room for personal projects or even enjoying life. On weekends, I spend time with my girlfriend, who's my priority. We've been together for a year and three months now. I still live with my parents, who run a business reselling new and used industrial equipment alongside my uncle. Id love to work with them, but they told me theres no room for me in the business at the moment. They earn really well and work from home most of the time, only going out occasionally to pick up or fix equipment. I wish I could have a life like theirs, but I don't consider myself entrepreneurial enough. I thought about buying an electronics course to learn general repairs, then start fixing and selling broken appliances or computers. But it feels like the market for this is tough unless I have contacts with cheap suppliers, otherwise its not worth trying. I also considered day trading, but Im unsure if its worth it since it seems you need a lot of money to start making profits. Ive saved up R$5,000 (around $1,000 USD, considering the Brazilian economy where $1 equals about R$6), and I want to invest it in something. One thing I know for sure: I dont want a regular 9-to-5 job. My girlfriend and I are also thinking about doing an exchange program in an English-speaking country with a strong economy. My dads friend did this and worked as a nanny through a specific program, earning really well for six months. It was an amazing experience for him. Im fluent in English, so I think it would be fine for me. Ive given my girlfriend a year to study English so we can go together, but Im still not sure. Ive also thought about studying Psychology since it seems like a career that pays well and allows you to work from home. Im really interested in emotional health and psychological disorders (Im diagnosed with borderline personality disorder) and have studied these topics a lot on my own. Im really lost about what step to take next. My plan for now is to stay at my current job for six more months and then start taking sick leaves back-to-back to get fired and qualify for unemployment benefits. This way, Id have 100% of my time to focus on my personal projects. If that doesnt work out, Im considering joining a nearby company that has a night shift, where Id work only six hours and earn more than I do now. My biggest dream is to live in Canada. I dont plan to buy a house in Brazil before becoming a citizen there. If anyone with more life experience could share some advice, Id really appreciate it. Any tips or guidance would mean a lot to me because this lack of direction and constant questioning is causing me serious mental health crises, with suicidal thoughts at times.

youngadults,2025-01-15 07:44:04,Parents Vs sharing bed with S/O,"To give background im a 20 year old female and ive been with my 22 year old boyfriend for 4 years now. I live at home with my parents, I go to school full time and I work full time as a manager. I dont go to parties and have even cut friends off because i didnt agree with their lifestyle choices. I pay for my car/car insurance, health insurance, and phone bill. So to say I believe that for my age Im pretty responsible and have it together. My parents both grew up catholic but lived pretty free lives with going on trips without their parents at 18 years old and even going to clubs. In October 2024 after my 4 anniversary with my boyfriend we went to Disneyland for 4 nights by ourselves. It was our first trip alone and I thought it was the right time since it has been 4 years and I am 20 years old and he was 21 at the time. I told my parents and they were iffy about us sharing a bed which I completely understand because of their background. But keep in mind my parents never talked to me about relationship expectations of sharing a bed, sex, being alone, and when to get married etc. So anyways not a huge debate or anything we went on a trip and had fun, came back home and parents asked how it was and normal etc. So i figured i got over the hurdle and dont need to worry about that anymore. Now its time to plan for my 21st birthday Hawaii trip in July. Originally my cousins and boyfriend and I were going to share a room to cut the costs down, but a few weeks ago both my cousins said that they were no longer going. I told my parents about this and all they said was that it sucked that they arent going but regardless we will have fun cause they are going as well. Me and my boyfriend book our plane tickets and hotel last week and my parents knew this because i told them and asked about what seats they got so we can sit close to them on the plane. Fast foward to tonight me and my stepmom are in the car alone and were discussing the trip and how its odd that my cousins arent going. Then somehow we get into the topic of me and my boyfriend having our own room and she blurted out if im being honest me and your dad are so uncomfortable with the two of you being alone in a room with one bed I was definitely thrown off because why not tell me prior to me and my boyfriend was paying $1800 to book this trip if this was an issue??! Not that it would really change anything as we are both young adults and im certainly not going to not celebrate my 21st because they are not comfortable. I dont know if im being unreasonable but I feel like no matter how hard I try to do everything right in their eyes this topic of sharing a room will always over shadow those things. I understand their perspective even though they will not verbally say or even have a conversation with me regarding the future of my relationship or what their expectations are. It feels like they want some way to control me or have a say in something. I respect their boundaries of him never being in my room, we are never at my house alone, and we waited 4 years to go on vacation alone and 3 years to even go on vacation together. I dont know if they expect me to wait until i get married to be alone with my boyfriend in a bedroom or vacation ( they are literally in the same hotel as us) and want me to be chaperoned like a child until im married. But i dont believe in rushing to get married just to go on vacation with my boyfriend with peace and mind. Im doing this on my dime, not theres. Just need others opinions on this situation. Some might say move out and if I do that im going to get an earful :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1i1sgut/parents_vs_sharing_bed_with_so/,0

They absolutely can be emotionally mature and emotionally intelligent. Everyone can! Its this weird gendering of emotions that perpetuates this fallacy! All this aside, if I never meet an emotionally intelligent or mature man, then I most certainly will not lower my standards! Ill just stay single! Okay rant over. I was just really bothered by this.

Just sharing some thoughts here, feel free to share your perspective! Do you also have that feeling that you have to choose a path and then stick to it? Since my early 20s I've changed only 2 jobs (I worked in one company for 6 years and then for another company for 1.5 years, both in marketing/copywriting field). Right now I'm kinda in a very special time of my life and if I manage to get through it, I'll be having a fresh start. And what bothers me is that I have so many ideas and things I want to try, but it feels if you start doing something, you should invest a huuuge amount of time and other resources to figure things out in order to succeed. And after you built that expertise, it seems non-reasonable to switch to completely different field and start from scratch again. For example, I like playing games (video and tabletop ones) but I don't have much expertise in creating them. Yet, that's something I was always interested in, so right now I'm slowly building my own tabletop game. At the same time I have a passion for traveling, so doing some stuff in that niche also would be cool. But moving back to the marketing/copywriting field in which I was working seems the safest choice, as I already have connections and expertise there, so is it reasonable to abandon it and switching to the tabletop development where I have to learn from scratch...

youngadults,2025-01-10 20:49:20,Where to relocate to as a young adult?,"Hi everyone! Just to get started, I'm a 23 year old Male from the UK looking to move out of my town (small town in lincolnshire) asap and I've been so stuck on what to do or where to relocate to for a long time. I have essentially no bills other than a 1 grand bank loan im paying back, phone bill, tiny amount of rent, car bills etc. I have absolutely outgrown my environment, most of my closes friends have moved away so I am ready to move myself as staying in this place for any longer simply isn't an option for me. My first idea was to settle down somewhere in the uk (Leeds or Manchester) and start a career in marketing or try and get myself into some type of automotive media, content creation or marketing as I'm massively into my cars and I really enjoy photography, editing and generally being a creative. I am also really into my electronic music (old school 90's hard house/trance etc) and I do DJ as a hobby however It would be nice to potentially put myself in a place where the opportunity could come to play in front of an actual crowd. This is why I had the idea of Leeds and Manchester as these seem to suit my needs pretty perfectly. My second Idea was to move abroad and settle down somewhere that is warm, hopefully near the beach with a nice nightlife. This doesn't have to be for ages, could be only 6 months to a year or maybe more (fingers crossed) and have a complete switch up of lifestyle in a warmer climate or even just another country (I get pretty horrible seasonal depression or maybe its just England). Of course theres the main ones like Melbourne, Australia Phuket, Thailand etc etc and these do seem very very appealing to me but I am worried that the grass may not be always greener. I also done some research and I really like the idea of Cyprus. More specifically near Ayia Napa. The country itself seems like there a decent amount to do with mountains and even skiing (I really enjoy nature walks and am good at skiiing) and of course the weather and nightlife. For me it would be finding work (remote marketing) to help with this but I am half way there and I also do have a side husstle which helps which is remote. I've also been looking at other places such as spain, italy, croatia and even Canada (I know its not warm but I love the nature of the place). Also looked into Switzerland. My final option is to not really care about my preferences and just kinda go travelling in Asia, Canada, Australia or even somehwere else. This will kinda get rid of the stress of the 'perfect scenario' and put myself out of my comfort zone to try new experiences. I also have had my eye on other countries also such as Finland, Switzerland, Iceland and maybe try to connect with nature more as I in a huge mental rut and just always glued to my phone. I could do this and then maybe come back and move to a place in the UK I want and THEN maybe focus on my career etc. Or I may love where I am and stay? You never know. I'm at the point in my life where I am just fed up overthinking myself into oblivion as it's pretty much ruining my life and I cannot get anything productive done. I have been thinking about this for 2 years now and I deep down know something NEEDS to change. I need to put myself in places that aligns with who I am and what I want in life. Please any opinions on this or any suggestions will be so so helpful. Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1hyekwt/where_to_relocate_to_as_a_young_adult/,3

My girlfriend had just dumped and I couldn't find a job, not even as a cashier, and also I live in a new country where I lack having as many friends as I would like to, so I felt really lonely (still do). After working for a horrible company with horrible conditions my father told me to resign and go work with him. To understand this better, I studied journalism. I dropped off in my final year and studied an audiovisual technician formation with the intention of working on a TV station. After that I did a ""masters"" in audiovisual post production (editing) for very high end kind of jobs. Well, I couldn't find a single job. The only time I got an interview it was for an internship and an hour later they called me back to tell me to not go to the interview because they found another candidate. Saying that I felt like a complete waste of shit, is putting it mildly. So my father took me to build Radio transmission racks. Yeah... nothing to do with my formation, but a job is a job. I was hired for only 3 months, because it is a small company and they hired me because they had a high volume of work. After that, my father tried talking with friends to find me a job in the same area, so now I got the chance to work for a company that does the same thing, but for the army and NATO. I have to say, I'm ok with my current job, and I hope I get to stay. Just wanted to say that damn, it really feels good to finally find some stability in your life.

youngadults,2025-01-05 21:54:33,"Mom pressures me to maintain her, I am leaving the house","Dear folks, it's not easy being alive. Our life is molded by certain crucial decisions we have to take along the way, all of which have consequences that we have to carry in our backs. Taking such a decision, where no option is clearly better than the alternative, is tough. And it is not the first time I've worked through this decision. Two times I have tried to leave this house, and two times I have gotten cold feet right at the last moment, last time ending up at the hospital. One may think that, for a 26 yo person, such a move would only be natural. Even more so considering staying here longer would be a bleak prospect and would make it harder to leave as the situation would become chronic. She has emotionally relied on me since I was a child, even though she obviously shouldn't've, and that has degraded into this. I don't want to make a grandiose speech about having the right to live a life, move away from a toxic environment, get to know someone, possibly creating a family... And that a 51 yo person can and has to work to provide for herself. But I do not want to do it. I do not want to set up high expections I may not be able to live up to, nor do I want to hype the moment in which I'll leave, as it would emotionally exhaust me. That would be unfair. This will not be the most difficult thing I'll ever do. This is one more decision I take along the way. I wasn't sure I would like the bachelor's degree I chose nine years ago, just as I didn't know if taking my current job would be the right choice a few months ago, and I have legitimate concerns about leaving this place. But I have come to learn that uncertainty is, to a certain degree, inevitable, and that, despite the uncertain, we have got to keep moving forward and doing what's right not because it's pleasant, but because it is right. I'm sorry not to get into more details, but I've been thinking very hard and for long about this and I am frankly fatigued. Besides, I'm settled.

youngadults,2025-01-03 20:41:13,lost and dont know what to do,"hi! 23 here and this past year i moved back home to utah. the end of march to be exact after living in orlando, florida for the last three years. since 2021 (i was 20 when i moved down). i loved my life in florida, i loved my job working for disney (and its perks hehe), and i made life long, best friends. it was the first time i was out on my own and while it was difficult, i was able to build a life in florida that i was really proud of. towards the end of 2023, i had a couple of situations that i felt were signs from mother universe telling me that i should move back home to utah. i had already been thinking it and had visited utah a couple of times since moving down to florida and really came to appreciate utah after being away from it. anyway, right before i left florida, shit hit the fan. and already having rose colored lenses for utah, it just became clear to me that maybe my time in florida was done. i almost lost my job with disney in what was a very stressful month in and out of offices for something stupid that i never shouldve done (long story for another time). my roommates at the time were people i was (and still am) very close to and not just them but their family as well. i worked with her dad and brother, and honestly became part of her family. but mom and dad got a divorce and shit got crazy and i got involved (and they involved me even after i told them i wanted no part in this after already been through two divorces ) and it almost ruined my relationships with everyone in the family. which then made my living situation very stressful. i never wanted to come home, i didnt want anything to do with them. i was constantly in a state of fear and anxiety over what was going to happen next. and it wasnt like i could escape to my bedroom because my roommates mother, the poor woman who got dumped by her now ex-husband, was crashing in my room for what ended up being three months. and in all this chaos, i was behaving in ways that wasnt like me. i was lying, not being honest, acting irrational, playing sides to please everyone and to not upset anyone. and it all blew up in my face in the name of just trying to be there for my people. long story short, i thought it was time to go. so i left, and when i left i said goodbye. that was it, i was done and was never coming back (in the sense of living there, pls i was always going to visit). and i felt that i had made peace with that. so i moved back home to utah in 2024. first week back was great, exciting, but then something happened to me that has never happened before. i was sobbing every day. now im not really an emotional person, unless it comes to cinema, so it was strange. and what turned into sobbing, turned into couldnt get out of bed sobbing. im not exaggerating when i say, for two months i couldnt get out of bed, i physically couldnt. i was so depressed and i didnt understand why. i told myself its just the transition period and ill get over it. but i never really did. i eventually was able to climb myself out of my bed and start anew but now its more counting down the days until the next time i get the sads. its now 2025, and ive decided to go back to florida twice now. i decided in august i was going back but then changed my mind in november. then last month, december, i decided nope i actually am going back and now i dont know if i should. i have a great job here at fedex. my rent is cheap (renting a basement) and my whole family is here. and i love being close to them. i dont have much friends here and the ones i do are, funnily enough are moving. and everyone has been telling me, oh its just because when you came here it wasnt what you had in mind, people have moved on and so you need to move on from that perception in your mind. but i came done here multiple times while living in florida. i saw the change. i saw how my people had moved on. and they saw how i moved on. and i didnt move back for anyone, i moved back cause i thought florida had enough of me. that florida was driving me out. that florida wasnt good for me anymore. but i fear that i was just running away from myself and my actions and my words that i hated. that i felt was being brought out of me because of other things not me in florida, when instead it was me. *cue anti-hero by taylor swift*. im just lost, im afraid to go back and regret that i left utah. im scared i havent really grown all that much. im scared to start all over again. im lost in how im going to achieve my dreams in life, and if i could even do that in florida (i want to make music, write and sing my own songs) or would it be better to do that here in utah. i dont know. i just dont want to be constantly uprooting my life and constantly have nothing to show for because im moving all over the country every other year. especially when everyone else around me has graduated, have great relationships, have great career jobs. and im just here. stuck. lost. im sorry for this extremely long, vague, post, but im seriously so lost. and my 73 year old therapist isnt helping . any

I just dont look good shaved and the attention I get with the hair is night and day, so Im curious if its a big deal or not!","Lost my hair to a telogen alopecia at 17, I'm a pasty white man and tanning isn't a thing for me. I've got a massive birthmark of my scalp. It's so frustrating because every other part of me I like and I take care of myself but the reality is I don't look good bald. I just don't. My alopecia thins hair diffusely so I still have eyebrows, they are thin but it's not noticeable. Facial hair is noticeable (also bald and beard combo aged people like crazy an I'm just not a fan) a year ago I began getting full custom male wigs and the tech has come a long way. I'm open about it to everyone close and coworkers etc. everyone was impressed with how it looked. My attention from women skyrocketed. My confidence didn't change, my social habits didn't. Just the hair. I'm not going back, I don't care if some fragile view of masculinity some others posses say a guy can't wear a wig, screw that. It's no different than fake teeth or makeup or extensions etc. transplants aren't options for most men, treatments have low success rates and overall while many guys look fine shaved, many more simply don't. I don't know where as a society we decided bald men were okay to mock and then mock more for doing steps to rectify it but I don't give a damn. I'm happy with the wig. Anyway, I'm curious when to share with dates. 26 now, and I'm thinking date 2/3 depending on how it goes. I think it's something that is best brought up early so someone doesn't feel like I hid it but also not first date material (I have eczema too, and don't feel the need to share that) So I'm curious on your opinion of when I should share and also how you'd feel about it, please note I'm happy with having hair so you're not going to dissuade me on that front.

Unfortunately, I (19) am one of her kids she infantalises to high heavens. However it's a bit of a weird situation with me since when I actually start behaving the way she treats me (younger than I actually am such as getting things wrong when she makes me do her complex tasks), suddenly I'm old enough to get married, old enough to have a baby, old enough to go to a night club, old enough to need a boyfriend or she'll genuinely think that I'm a lesbian, ect. Despite treating me like I'm a kid half my age, I get proper adult responsibilities from my parents and, of course, do not receive adult privileges with it. One thing I thought she genuinely left back in my childhood was making me eat foods I don't like. She hasn't done this to me since I was about 14-15 so I have no idea what's going on to make her think this is okay again. She served me up a bowl of pasta she knows damn well I hate and won't eat and is telling me I **have** to eat it or I will get punished. I don't know what the punishment will be but it will probably be some dumb kid punishment like being sent to bed early or not being allowed on my devices. As I'm writing this my mum is in the shower and she will be out any minute now and I've only half finished my bowl of pasta I'm eating while gagging because it's terrible taste. I'd put some in the bin but when my brother (12) did that some minutes ago he got in big trouble and my mum punished the whole family by not taking them out to see the new years fireworks because ""those who don't eat the food I make don't get rewarded"" or whatever she kept saying. Does anyone have advice on what I should do? What I should say? How I can force this food down my throat quickly (it's getting cold which makes it worse)? How can I prevent this from happening again?

I come from a family of poverty and was forced to leave home at 18. Ive been on my own since then, working hard to get by, but Im at a point where I need to figure out my next steps financially and career-wise. Right now, Im working as a leasing agent at a C-class property, but I know that its not a long-term career option for me. The property is incredibly unsafe and horribly managed. My manager recommends that I keep a gun on me at all times (I do not own a gun but have considered it soley for this job)... on my first day a resident overdosed and their body had to be carried out right next to my desk. there is also nightly shootings at the property and we have a security task force of 30 men. I do not feel safe and this is not long-term for me. they have also forced me into a manager position with no increase in pay. Next month we will be hiring four new leasing agents, and I have been tasked with training them all and managing them. I will not receive a title upgrade or a pay raise. This job is incredibly detrimental to my mental health, but I don't know what else to do for income .. Ive been thinking about whether its a good idea to take out loans or apply for credit cards to build credit, but Im unsure if thats the right move for me financially at this point. I dont want to make any decisions that could hurt me in the long run, but Im also trying to figure out how to get ahead. For additional context, I have an apartment so I am splitting rent with a roommate. My portion is about $900-$1000 mo. Id love to hear from anyone who has experience with: \- Building credit when you come from a low-income background (and whether taking out loans/credit cards is a good idea) \- Career advicewhat paths should I consider to make sustainable, long-term income? Or are there good short-term options to make extra money while I figure things out? \- Any other tips for managing finances or getting started on a better financial path would be greatly appreciated! Im working hard and doing my best, but I feel stuck and could really use some direction. Any advice or experiences you can share would mean a lot.

youngadults,2024-12-30 13:53:42,Career Change,"Hello everyone, I'm a final year Economics student at a top UK university. I'm on track for a first and would like to pursue a career in Finance but due to a variety of circumstances I missed the boat when it came to summer internships and am probably going to graduate without a job offer. I believe that with dedication I can eventually get a job in Finance though it may take a year, and I may have to study an expensive Masters. None of this is a major issue in the scale of life (though it is an inconvenience and I feel like shit for missing out on the internships) however, I'm conflicted by something else. Despite three years of Economics, I'm still not sure whether I love the subject, and I'm even less convinced by Finance. Part of me yearns to say 'fuck it' and forget Economics and Finance completely when I graduate in July. Instead, I'm tempted to take a year out and reapply to study an undergraduate degree in engineering and pursue my dream of being an F1 engineer. My question is: is my dream of being an F1 engineer transitory? While I've loved F1 my whole life, the idea of being an engineer is relatively recent (last six months), and while I love creativity, I think my creativity lies in writing not designing. I also think part of me is terrified by the uncertainty caused by missing the boat on internships, and I know that it's generally not a good idea to make a decision when you're scared.

Officially we broke things off a couple of months (no communication whatsoever) but a year of feeling truly alone. After that it's been hard for me to jump into a relationship. Im a hopeless romantic and no one seemed to catch my eye even when they were chasing me. Normally I should feel good about that but I dont? I think something is wrong with me as a guy because everyone around me is saying I should feel good about that. My friends gave me advice that I should write it down and manifest it. Not sure if I really did that since I wasnt sure it was ever gonna work (or give me false hope). But it was a cool idea dont get me wrong. I love their advices. I forgot to mention- after my relationship ended, I moved to an entirely different state . So new area and a fresh start since I was depressed and miserable back home. So I felt truly alone for these couple of months of being in a new state . Im also 22 years old if that matters. Im also high as I vent because I felt inspired I guess. Now: Now that I felt ready- no one really catches my attention. They were cute and pretty but I want someone was able to scratch my brain (not literally lol). It's been no luck whatsoever so left it to God and I started focusing on my college path. Got into a neat school of my choice. Then I matched with this girl on tinder. We talked all day after she gave me her number. It felt so authentic and raw. I was idk. Like something feels good that I haven't felt for a year and some change. Anyways, I decided to ask for a call the same day (normally I don't like being on the phone with strangers). We ended up talking for 2 hours and it didn't feel like 2 hours. So now we're here.

Clever, I cant say crap to that. Its not that hes forceful or disrespectful or anything like that, still, it bothers me that I have to report to him on everything, all the time. Literally.

A friend at my gym who knows about my scars told me that I didnt have to cover them at the gym if I didnt want to. He said the community is pretty body positive, and if anyone gave me flack hed tell them off. I might try not wearing long sleeves at the gym tomorrow. Maybe Ill wig out but I think I want to stop worrying about whether or not my scars are visible. Besides, people are usually so focused on the workouts they probably dont even notice my scars.

My parents that I'm living with now are my grandparents and we are constantly at odds and no matter how much I try to do the right thing it always goes wrong, like recently I bought new furniture for my room, a dresser and a TV stand, I already had one from when I lived here previously but it's constantly a mess and I wanted to try to find something I could manage better but my dad said I wasted my money on something I didn't need and forbid me from purchasing anything else because obviously I just don't make good purchase decisions, furthermore they are angry because I see a therapist because apparently that means that I'm not putting God first and I'm disrespecting them by not talking to them about my problems, and hurting my mom by continuing therapy. I don't want to quit therapy because for the first time in my life in the past two years I feel better and more at peace but it just causes so much tension I've considered quitting just to make them happy, I decided to take a year off from college because my dad doesn't want to drive me anymore and there is no public transportation so I wouldn't be able to get there, I don't drive yet because of my disability and I have to fill out so much paperwork and stuff just to get my license and it's going to take a while, and now that I live with my parents I don't get my disability check because I'm lucky to be living here for that much and not having to pay anything and I'm at my wits end because I'm trying to stay positive but everything keeps going downhill and I don't know what to do or how to make it better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1hdxam9/i_need_advice_honestly/,1

Iykyk but I really want the clean girl aesthetic, not just because other people are that way but thats just what I try to do but I never have the energy to do so.

Meanwhile, Im so tired and lazy I can barely bring myself to brush my teeth before bed. I also feel like I just dress like a child, (mis matched sweats) I feel like I eat like a child, and just my hobbies as well. Since moving in with my boyfriend I started playing a lot of video games. I work a corporate job but I also teach yoga on the side. All the other instructors there seem so stereotypical yoga instructor (teeny tiny, always with a matching set on, nails done, looking good).

youngadults,2024-12-10 15:33:53,Attraction vs liking someone,"Am I tripping or is attraction not an initial reason why someone will approach another person in hopes of talking/dating them.. Like, being attracted to someone does not automatically mean you like them, obviously you need to talk to them after and then from there you determine if you like them or not. But youre not gonna know theyre personality before you talk to them, and realistically youre not gonna talk to them unless youre attracted to them. And again, this whole thing is referring to having intentions on being with a person. Friendships are a whole different thing, Ik you can become friends with a person regardless of what they look like and then from there getting to know each other you build an attraction to them. But stranger to stranger, 9/10 times its based off attraction. Lmao, sorry Im just confused cause I was complaining about how some guys on dating apps dont show their whole face and like 2 different guys tried arguing with me about being skin deep and only liking someone based on looks.

youngadults,2024-12-09 19:09:33,Just in need of some advice,"Greetings all, I am a 21F who is lonely and afraid. Even though I'm set to graduate this month and should be incredibly happy. I have a good career field with excellent potential for growth (nursing), yet I feel as if though I have wasted my life. For starters, I turned my four-year bachelor's degree into two because at the time of entering college I was sure of what I wanted to do and worked incredibly hard to get it- i.e. I went through an accelerated nursing program. Nevertheless, while completing my clinical rotations I kind of figured that may this wasn't the career for me. So, I went and spoke to an academic advisor about potentially switching to engineering (a degree field that would be worth the transition). I though that if I could go through an accelerated program, then I could accomplish anything I put my mind to. Nevertheless, I found out to my despair that none of my classes switched over and that 'd be essentially losing all of the time and money I'd put forth- and I DEFINITLEY did not have the money (not enough scholarship to stretch additional years)!!! Thus, I continued on in pursuit of my original field. I understand that I should be excited for my future, but here I am 21 years old and running out of time as to what to pursue in my future. Not to mention my longtime boyfriend recently left me for his own personal issues that didn't really involve but nevertheless I understand his pursuit for happiness. So here I am- about the graduate college, lonely, and unsure of what's to come. I really and truly want to be happy. Sometimes I wish that when growing up my parents provided me with more options about the possibilities of life- ways to make money, multiple career fields. For my brother that may have been true, my dad was sure not to short him of any ways to be successful because he's ""a man"" and needs to know these things. While I was pushed towards college. And don't get me wrong college wasn't a bad deal, but I just hate the fact that after I took a few courses and realized things weren't for me it was nearly impossible to switch and like I previously said I just didn't have the funding for it. IDK what I'm accomplishing by writing this; it's my best guess that I just really need some HELP! I need someone or something to happen or to show me that I haven't wasted my life or my opportunity for happiness.

youngadults,2024-12-04 15:01:17,"Scared by my living conditions, what do I do? HELP","So Im in a bit of a situation here. Back in the beginning of Feb of this year my fianc( 23 M )and I (25 F) moved to another state with the rest of my bio family; during this time I was pregnant. The move was really fast and I felt like my family wasnt prepared. I told my mother that we would try it for a year and if we didnt like it we would do something else. Well this last year has been hell. I let me parents talk me into wanting to move with them because they needed my name in the house and I thought it would be better for my baby in the long run. Long story short things were said to me about not unpacking there things fast enough or didnt organize anything. ( we did; theres 14 of us and he was my fianc and I left to unload it until they could bring the rest of our stuff). I milked my pregnancy and didnt do anything. We gave up all our shaving to get everyone over here. My parents maxed out my credit card. They put my name on the tractor here they got. It all came to a head during my birth. My fianc got into it with my family because he thought I wanted everyone to be quiet so he was trying to insure that. Plus we did a home birth so he was. Stressed out because we were an hour away from a hospital that has a pediatrician unit. He snapped at my family for things. This cause a whole storm. During my birth my dad said something and left made a sense. Two of my brothers left to the bar because they were going to fight him supposedly. The younger three went upstairs. My mom sat on the stairs until our son came out. I was moved into my bedroom to get stitches. My fianc left to go upstairs; and didnt come back for awhile. I guess my dad was yelling at him and threatening to kick his ass. I didnt know at the time and was asking for my mom and no one could find her. My grandma came in and held my hand. My mom came in at the end looked at my son said something to me and left. I didnt see them until the next day when I woke up in the afternoon. I went upstairs with my son to see them and I got ambushed about the birth and how I shouldnt marry him. That he was controlling. I was hormonal and wasnt thinking straight so I came down here and got into an argument with him about it. The next two days I got sick I ended up going septic and had to stay in the hospital for a week. I told my fianc something was wrong and I ask my mom to come down cause I was scared. She tried not to come down here at all because of my fianc. I felt like I had to beg her to come check on me. There things were awkward but I thought they were on the mend. My fianc apologize and was doing a lot to mend their relationship between them. I have had hard feeling about my birth because I felt abandoned by them and that they put there emotions in front of the my sons birth. Well finally I blew up on my parents the other day. We came home from visiting my fianc sister. My dad was trying to put his cold hands on me and I told him to stop like 3 times. The 4th time he went to do it I snapped a bit and shoved his hands away. My dad then mumbled something under his breath and left. He came out 10 mins later and I was sitting at the table when he told me that I didnt want to start anything with him cause I wouldnt like it. Thats when I went off about what his problem is. Apparently I didnt specifically tell him we were going to his sisters. I dont know how he didnt know I told every for a month even my aunt who was here for a week and a half new I was going. I told him that. He told me he didnt know anything and that it was my fault. That I act different now that my fianc was home full time. (I spend more time with them but I dont see how else, there are the family I am making so I think thats fine) my father then said he was going to kick my fianc butt. Every time I say something he or one of my brothers doesnt like they first thing is to threaten to fight him. I told them how I felt abandoned at the end of my birth. This sent my dad into a furry he told me that I was spoiled ungrateful brat because I said I felt that way. That I needed them for money, I wouldnt if they would stop talking everything. Ffs my mom has taken over my bank account cause hers got hacked. My dad told me f*** you and that I could never take that back. My brother told me that I deserved the rude things they said to me during my pregnancy. When I didnt reach the way he wanted he would get CM away from my nose and try to stare me down. When that didnt work he resorted to trying to say things to hurt my feelings. Like I abandoned them during my birth and it was all my fault. I want to leave and head back to the area we are from. I cant feel safe here with this whole situation. The thing is I know it will start another fight. My bio Fam is notorious for cutting people off if they dont like what you did. We wanted to leave and not tell anyone but I feel like I can do that to my mom, grandma, and little brothers. I still want them in my life and my sons but I cant live here anymore Im not happy and I dont feel safe. I guess Im asking if I am thinking clearly?

youngadults,2024-12-04 06:15:59,Am I a bad person for these age gaps?,"I just turned twenty and I am seriously questioning the way I conducted myself these past two years. Ever since I was sixteen, I have been talking to men in their thirties and doing more than questionable things for these characters. When I turned eighteen, I fear I may have repeated this cycle. I met a boy at college who started doing unwanted sexual acts to me since the very first night he managed to get alone with me. I was incoherent most of the time and ended up devoting the majority of my time to my eating disorder. I started binging and purging constantly, reached a body mass index of 15, and didn't do anything when I left the house other than exercise to burn calories. So I eventually got sent to treatment. Eating disorder treatment isolated me from my academic responsibilities, and I couldn't get a job having lost access to my proof of identity. So rather then using this time productively, I spent most of my time online meeting strangers on the internet. Most of these people were creepy men at least half a decade older than me, but two of them were under eighteen. One of the two boys in this category I got in an online relationship with and I started communicating both romantically and sexually with him. We had a two year age gap, and he insisted that I shouldn't feel guilty as this was legal in his state. So I started speaking to him everyday and fully intended on getting in a long term relationship with him, read my post history if your curious why that didn't work out. With the other boy, I was aware of his age and talked to him in spite of the same age gap. I eventually found him on social media and started occasionally browsing his profile. But today I got a text where he informed me that he was strung out on drugs when we met and that he found it predatory of me to still keep track of him (I understand that fully). So I blocked him as he requested and I intend on never speaking to him again. But this raises the question for me, am I a predator? With both of them I was aware that they were minors and I eighteen-nineteen year old, and yet I would speak to them nonetheless. I feel disgusted with myself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1h69k2w/am_i_a_bad_person_for_these_age_gaps/,1

youngadults,2024-11-30 20:53:12,I'm ready to move out.,"There I said it. I (22M) am getting tired of feeling like I'm still confined to my mom in one way or another. Long story short, I just feel like we're budding heads in multiple areas. We don't despise being around each other, but we're growing different opinions and motives in our lives. I'm just tired of feeling like nothing is changing as we're quickly getting older. For one, I'm exhausted living in our area. We've been here for 10+ years and it's coming to shit. Crime, influx of people who don't care about others property, no real community, gotta drive everywhere, seasonal depression, the same old, same old. I want a new environment. Our house still has stuff everywhere (not like hoarder everywhere, but it's noticeable) that my mom still continues to buy certain things. God forbid if I make any mention of it. While I try to minimize things within my room, I'm just outgrowing it. I also think the bigger picture here is the independence. She finances both of our cars thankfully. But I don't want her to do that any longer. Insurance raised on the car due to my grandparent sending it into the woods by accident and causing over 6K in damages. I'm back to actively looking for some small minimum wage gig to help pay off the car until it's time for my summer internship. The topic of said internship: my second FAANG internship (or big tech internship; recently finished one this past summer in Colorado). Housing is paid by the company and I will still receive bi-weekly paychecks. It's in an area of LOVE within Silicone Valley. Been there multiple times, and I think it's more so me loving a new environment and people than me wanting to move there as it's expensive. With upcoming money from my taxes, scholarship refund, and working (hopefully), I'm expecting to save and consider options sometime next year. Goal is 10K which isn't hard. Funny enough, I anted to maybe consider getting another car with that money, but that's a dumb idea at my age. Rather pay the car I have now off and just keep it for a bit until I can grow my potential startup I'm working on. Honestly very off topic, I hate driving. I wish I could sell the thing right after. I have a $2,000 EV bike I got for $600 brand new in Colorado that I'd shipped back home this past summer during my internship. No car note or insurance sounds great. Can't ride it anywhere over here without the worry of it being stolen unfortunately. Our family finances aren't always the best. She took on a timeshare with my siblings biological dad for 20K I kept mentioning to not take. But I will say we're actively looking at downsizing our expenses and maybe surrender my car. I got a bucket I can kick around in fr. Again, we don't have animosity in our household. I'm just ready to build my life. I've been within my hometown since I was born. Being exposed to different views within your life will make you understand there's more to life than what I'm used to. I want the same for my younger sibling. I know many people say to stay with our parents as much as possible within your early 20s and just build, so I need guidance on such a big decision.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1h3m3ip/im_ready_to_move_out/,5
youngadults,2024-11-30 17:21:33,Rant (if you want to read something stupid here is my 3am brain ranting after a cry),"I have forced myself to be more angry and emotionless since I was young, and I have been doing it for so long that I won't even let myself be happy sometimes. I have done it because I always felt ignored whenever I wound speak, so I just stopped myself from speaking, and when I did speak people would put me down making me feel stupid, now a lot of people say that I am rude because the way that I respond is ""dry"". If I have nothing to say I won't say anything, I'm not trying to be rude, I literally have nothing to say, so I don't say anything, if I'm really not being rude I will nod my head or 'mhm', something like that, or I just forget to respond. People make me feel stupid for even trying sometimes, especially my family, and it just makes everything ten times worse, I even started to stutter really bad, everyword I wouldn't be able to get out properly because I was stuttering my family and people around me would just laugh at my struggling, and that would set me back again. I think because I often shut myself down and don't let people see my emotions, the vulnerable side of me, no one really knows how much of a sensitive person I am, and how emotional I really get from things, they probably think that I am a brick wall and have no emotions, but in typical girl fashion, I don't show any signs of me being upset so no one knows and I just expect them to check up on me or something, and if something is actually wrong I don't tell anyone, but I also don't really trust anyone to be able to tell.

youngadults,2024-11-29 15:28:05,Am I second fiddle to his ex in his familys mind. His ex is tearing us apart it feels like.,"This is a long story Im about to tell. Im adding in all the details I know so people can have the full picture. Polite criticism is always accepted! Im starting to question if his family likes me and if I am going to have to deal with this ex until she gets the message or? This starts back at the end of 22 beginning of 23 and goes to now end of 24. So I met my fianc back in May of 23 at work. He had recently gotten out of a 6.5-7 year long relationship back in September of 22. We will call his ex fiance D. They dated throughout high school and I can tell that at one point he really loved her (which is fine I knew we were gonna have previous partners). I couldnt tell if he was over what had happened between them or not. (He did woodland fire fighting and was gone during fire season; D cheated on him with a couple of his friends during that time). However, after they broke up D moved on and started dating someone I grew up with, this is a same sex relationship (this is important for later) so I wasnt worried about anything. We end up officially dating at the end of May. Our relationship goes great until the middle of July 23. I guess she started messaging him again. Asking about how hes doing and that she wanted to meet back up. I guess she asked multiple times before he told me she was messaging him. He told me that at first D wanted to check in with my fianc. Then when that didnt happen she wanted to meet up to see the dogs (they had 3 dogs together and she only took one when she left). Next, that it was she needed money for an electric bill that supposedly went to collection in her name from when they were together However all the bills were in my fianc name; I saw the bill she was talking about. After that she wanted closure. Finally, in September/ October of 23 D told him that the reason she really want to see him was to reconcile because she still loved him. Remind you she still is dating my friend. I was beyond upset, she had left almost a whole year before and she comes back when our relationship is getting serious. He told her to speak with her now partner and that it wasnt appropriate to say those things to him because he has moved on. I asked him to block her on social media because to me that was a big red flag that she was willing to try and separate our relationship. He told me he blocked her and we moved on. Of course they have mutual friends so Im sure she would still try and keep tabs. Man I was wrong so during the rest of October we continue with our relationship by this point we are six months deep. D starts trying to add me on everything! FB, IG, and SC to name a few I didnt add her back. Shes messaging me and Im not responding because I feel awkward. I also felt like she was trying to set me up to run into her. I say this because a mutual friend of ours would offer going out for drinks and as soon as I mention that my fianc and I planned on going out already and could meet up with our mutual friend ;she would make an excuse. Our mutual friend then would post pictures of D and her the same day we were supposed to go out. I shrugged it off. Now it gets wilder; come November 23 and I found out that I was pregnant. We didnt announce it to anyone but family and like three friends. When we told his family his dad made a comment This is a mistake, sipped some beer and left. At the time I took it as we rushed into things; I can respect that opinion. I mean it hurt but now Im wondering if its because his dad likes his ex more? We didnt announce it publicly until December. We made a big FB post and tag all our family in it! We got a lot of support! However, afterwards D gets on social media and makes a huge post about how 3 years ago my fianc and her went through a miscarriage. I only saw this because a lot of mutual friends were commenting on it. I ended up giving her my condolences. (Miscarriages are horrible! I really care about this so much so that my business is helping couples have children of their own!). Although, I felt like this was a little push back to us announcing. Kind of like he was mine first, type of boast. That was the last I heard of her for a couple months because in February 24 we moved out of state. I guess she was asking friends of ours what we were doing and they told her that we moved. This had her trying to reach out to family members of mine; she started adding them on social media. Remind you I did not know D before I got with my fianc. Besides that everything was amazing for a couple on months after that. Or at least I thought it was. I now know that I was just living in ignorance bliss. Our 1 year anniversary was in May 24. We got engaged! I found out later that he didnt even tell anyone that we were engaged or that he was going to propose to me until his family made a comment that they found out through my social media post. I felt like a AH cause I figure he would have told me he didnt tell anyone afterwards when I said I was going to post it. During this time I was getting notifications that she was going on my TT page and looking at it. At first I didnt know it was her until I looked at her page. Her name was unrelated to her and her profile picture was of nature from what I remember. I just ignored it and continued on with life. We attended a wedding and went back home to celebrate the baby shower with his family in June. Had our son in July. My mother-in-law came out to see him in August , it was a good time! I have been spending the time since my sons birth to adjust to being full time stay at home mom. Welp one day in October i notice he was getting a TON of calls and text. He usually gets calls for work. So I just assumed something happened in that department. This lasted for about 2-3 days in total. On day 2 I get on my social media and see all his family posting about how D was missing. She posted a goodbye of sort on her social media. Posting about how she wanted children and she was never going to have that. My friend, she was still dating as far as I know of, has a son from a previous relationship and since they are same sex they have to go through IVF to have children. I also had our son at this point too. Although at this point I didnt think that she knew our son was born. She was very clear when she first messaged my fianc that she only wanted a family with him and no one else. That she was struggling and the world was cold. Dont get me wrong sharing the post isnt what triggered me. I was really confused at this point because they all said they didnt like her and didnt associate with her really after they broke off the engagement. D did work where his parents did so they had a coworker relationship. However, something felt off. I chose to ignore it at this point. A couple weeks later I am looking for baby pictures of my fianc on social media because that was the only place that might have some according to my fianc. While Im going through the pictures on his familys account I notice his old engagement pictures up still. On his parents pages. They were calling her daughter and how they are excited. I was kind of hurt for a couple reasons. 1. The most I got from them was a congratulations, no post, nothing. 2. I specifically asked him to make sure to get photos. I suffered brain damage as a teenage and have short term memory issues. Pictures help trigger memories for me! He did not. 3. I asked him to get on one knee for the pictures. He sat the ring on our Togo boxes from dinner and handed me the boxes so he could get in the car. Then asked me after I asked him what the box was. 4. I know they know how to delete cause all the other photos of her are gone. 5. It wasnt the best proposal because he was grumpy from work and didnt want to go to out but wanted to do something special for our 1 year. We didnt go to the actual restaurant I picked out because it was an hour away and he complained about it earlier in the day (over text). I chose a little mom and pops restaurant that was close to us. I tried to find the silver lining in it. It was our one year and I love him. But it got worse from there cause I just tried to ignore the photos and continue looking for more baby photos of him. I notice that the times I have went of there for family festivities I have been left of out the photos his family post of the time spent together. I snapped after this and my brain went into overdrive. My fianc lets me go through his phone so I did. I see that he didnt block D and that-she has been messaging him. She sent her number to him, asked to meet up, and the topper messaged him 2 days before our son was born to tell him that she loves him. I go back to July 23 and see my fianc lied and told me he wasnt going to meet her. But the messages show he tells D to stop by anytime. Shes stocking him on IG and I figure out that is how she knew my son was born. I also see that his mom was telling him to give D money for the electric bill and him saying okay. He told me he was not going to give her money. I confronted him on this and he said that he told D to stop by before I expressed my unease at it. He later told her no after I told him. I asked why she wasnt blocked and was still messaging him that she loves him. He told me he forgot to block her on IG and would do it. He blocked her while telling me that he never responded to D after I expressed my unease about the situation the first time and he also didnt respond when his family, her family, and friends were calling him when she went missing. I was so upset that I couldnt stop crying. I brought up the engagement in total and asked about the photos because I specifically asked for them. He told me he didnt know why and that he admitted to rushing it. He asked me if I wanted him to redo the proposal. I explained that its a once in a lifetime thing for a girl thats what we are told growing up. Heck it didnt need to be grand he could have gotten on one knee in our back yard on a walk and had a family member hide and take pictures. People already know that we got engaged and I would feel stupid. I asked for engagement photos instead, he said ok. Well so far I have been the only one to mention it and he told me to just figure it out and let him know. Can he not find a photographer or ask family to take some photos on their phone? At this point I just kind of want to redo cause I feel like its just a sh** storm. I asked him if the relationship between his family and I was not what I thought it was because of the photos. He held me because of the crying and informed me that his family knew D longer and that is all. His parents worked at his high school they both attended. That they like me but want to get to know me more. I understand that and have been thinking of ways to build our bond. I think he told his mom because all of the sudden she was messaging me more and saying she loved us all; referring to our son, fianc and I. My mother-in-law still has the photos up. I know I cant tell her what pictures to have up but they really bother me. On top of that I see that she re added D on social media all of the sudden these past couple of weeks. I also know I cant tell her who to be friends with but Im wondering if my hunch is right or if I am paranoid? My mental health has tanked since October and I can hardly sleep now. I feel a-lot of emotions and just dont know what to think. Am I overthinking? Do I just need to build a bridge and get over it? Am I justified?

All I wanted was nothing more but to cut her off and become fully independent. After graduating, I lived accross the country with hardly any contact outside of a handful of phone calls for nearly 8 years. However, I recently found out from a relative that my mom has been suffering from a lot of health issues and I am fighting with conflicting feelings. Part of me really regrets the years of distancing myself and feels guilty for all the lost time with her. But the other part of me is still hurt she chose my abuser over me as a child. I try and forget and forgive as I now can rationalize her past actions and understand it is her first life too but it also just feels like there is such an empty hole inside me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1h04892/broken_relationship_with_mom_hurts_so_much_more/,5

The person in the video said No amount of focusing on yourself, no matter how much you do it, is ever gonna stop you or distract you from your desire for a relationship but tbh Id also add friendships to this statement too because thats exactly what Ive been going through for the past years. Ive focused on myself a lot these past couple of years, Ive bettered myself up and it still didnt stop my wish to finally have a stable group of friends who arent a bunch of pricks and a partner who genuinely likes me, nothing did, and when other people told me to just focus on myself it quite frankly pissed me off as I was doing that already! Ive done nothing but focus on myself, Ive reached my peak self-esteem, my social awkwardness for the most part stopped (I cant remove it completely I just cant), I started doing what I love, I went to the gym and exercised and yet those wishes were still there.

My mom is so ridiculously strict when it comes to us going out and spending the night out. My boyfriend always asks me to spend the night with him and as much as I want to, I know I'm going to get shit from my mom the next day. I spent one night with him a few weekends ago and had to lie and say I was with my friends. When I told her I was going, she yelled and said I'm getting out of control. When I came back, my sisters told me she was angry all weekend and yelling saying that I'm out there having fun while she's at home and worrying about me when really I know she slept just fine. She doesn't know about my boyfriend because if she does, she'll never let me stay out the night because she'll know I'm with him. As much as I want to tell her about him and have them meet, it will be harder to lie about who I'm with when I want to spend the night with him. He planned a nice date for us a few weeks from now and I want to spend the night so I need to tell my mom a lie from now so that I can go. My sister is 28 and is scared to go on vacation because my mom gives us such a hard time. She's never gone a vacation with her long-term boyfriend because my mom would give her a hard time. In my mom's mind, she's worried about what other people will think if they find out that we spent the night with a man! I'm soooo frustrated right now!

youngadults,2024-11-22 16:01:55,Mom & Relationship Conflict,"This is a long post but I would really appreciate some positive encouragement: Hi everyone, Im posting on here bc Im currently dealing with issues with my mom and my relationship. Im 19 and me and my gf are in uni. We are high achieving students, with her going to law school already on a 71% scholarship and me on the path to med school. We are also both Christian and are both virgins who are in our first relationship. Shes the only girl Ive ever taken out on a date. Weve been together for 9 months, tho we are temporarily broken up so I can handle the situation and we can both take a step back from it and heal. We do plan on coming back together in not too long from now. We are a couple who have always been very supportive of one another and pushed each other to enjoy friendships, time with family, serving others, and working hard. We dont argue, not bc we dont agree, but bc we dont see a need to fight when we can discuss. If we get sassy with one another, one of us always brings it to an end to avoid division. We are peacemakers. We also look out for each other. I look to keep her safe and she keeps check of my health. Making sure Im taken care of since my mom sometimes brushes health things under the rug. Now with that context there me and my mom began to have a lot of conflict. Upon getting a gf my mom seemed fine at first. Only one issue arose and that was the miles on my car. My car is a purchase but my parents had issues with the miles for some reason. Its a brand new Tesla model 3 abt a year old almost with 12-13k miles. I know these cars can take 250k miles and we never planned on selling it. My gf lives 30 miles from me and in the beginning I would drive there 2 times on the weekend and 3 times during the week but only for class at uni. I adjusted to take less miles on my car but my mom was always mad at me for the miles I had put on. About 4k in 3-4 months. After this issue passed my mom wondered why my gf wasnt coming anymore for abt 2 months. This was bc I wanted to honor a core value of hers she was raised with which is on the traditional side but is that I would drive to her and we would take her car back to my house. This was just a way she always wanted to be pursued, but she never meant it in a toxic way. She isnt the if he wanted to he would girl. I told her I disliked that and she agreed with me, since it can come from a place of pride and not genuine love. Anyways I didnt communicate this to my mom right away and we never implemented it bc I knew my mom wouldnt like this. June came around and my mom didnt like that I was driving to her house 2 times a week and she wasnt coming to ours. So I explained to my mom that its on me for not communicating and I explained what we wanted to try and she said no to it bc she didnt really agree with it. She asked for my gf to come at least 1 time a month but my gf wanted to do more and come 1 time a week to show my mom she never meant harm. We did this till September. In the summer my conflict with my mom heated up. She came against me nearly every week for not being home enough, not helping around the house enough, and for the miles which I was already fixing in the summer(averaging 1K a month). I worked full time basically the whole summer and did online classes for Uni, so I was pretty tired. I worked downtown so driving exhausted me still. But she said I didnt do enough at home. So again I adjusted. Spent more time with her, helped where I could, and saw my gf every Sunday while she saw me every Saturday at our house. My mom was always mad at me for some reason tho. Still cant pinpoint why. We brushed this off tho. I was the frustrated one and my gf told me to just be patient and keep loving them. My mom got more personal at times when she attacked me verbally. The whole summer she always said youre gonna be the one that abandons your family and this hurt bc I love my family and always have. She also cursed me out a few times, threatened to kick me out, and considered disagreement with her as disrespectful. So I gave up. I just submitted to the discipline and conflict and tried my best to keep pushing. I got exhausted after a while. Felt defeated and my gf witnessed all of this. Eventually it came to involve her. My mom got more frustrated and began to threaten to be more strict with my relationship. I told her this would hurt me and more importantly my gf but she said she knew and didnt really think twice abt it. So there the problems rlly started. In September my gf couldnt make it a few weekends in a row due to health issues, her birthday which we all went too, and in the end she broke down in tears bc she couldnt make it 3 times in a row. I calmed her down and asked my parents if I could go visit my gf on that Saturday bc she was feeling horrible. My dad said yea ofc, my mom got rlly mad and said she would sacrifice her body by cleaning after work on Fridays for my gf to come but that my gf cancelled on us last minute. I told my mom its ok and its no ones fault that health issues arise. These issue came up last minute. My mom didnt let me go saying the weekends were hers and not my gfs so I couldnt go. My mom didnt spend time with me that day anyways and my gf got rlly frustrated bc she needed me and my mom didnt let me go only to keep me home and not spend time with me. Yes I would see my gf after uni every Tuesday-Thursday from roughly 2/3pm till 8-8:30pm. But we wanted to have the chance to see each other Saturdays even if it was for like just a late night date, bc there isnt much you can do during the weekday, when we have class the next day. Anyways my gf felt hurt bc my mom didnt let me be there for her the one time she really asked for it. My gf was to there for me and my family at times when it got her sick, was not safe for her bc of period cramps that made her dizzy, and when it meant sacrificing her only day of the week she had with family. She felt hurt that my mom wouldnt let me sacrifice in the same way for her. This is where the real conflict started. My mom began to say my gf wasnt a real Christian bc she didnt come to my mom to address this. My gf just didnt want to overstep boundaries and wanted to make sure she cooled her emotions down. In the end we had a talk all 3 of us. My gf explained her distresses and my mom said it was disrespectful of her to want an apology from my mom, since my mom said she was only trying to discipline me. My mom said our relationship wasnt of God, which is hurtful to her and me since we tried our best to always honor God as Christians who were leaders of other Christians at various points. In the end there relationship is pretty shattered and after that conversation my mom and dad said she was no longer welcome in our home for disrespect. This was really the final blow since my gf had felt hurt but never said they werent welcome anymore. They took away their blessing and eventually my mom made me choose between the two. To which I choose my girl. She went back on that word bc I guess she realized it was pretty harsh, but she still didnt approve. This whole thing got pretty messy pretty fast and I wanted to see what you all thought or what advice/encouragement you had to share. Thanks for reading and if you have the time, Im proud of my girl for getting into law school on such a big scholarship and would really appreciate if she could get some thumbs up or congrats.

I was really excited for this because she was legitimately the most attractive girl I've even come close to dating, and I've been out of state for several months, so I haven't had the opportunity to try and date in a while. Anyways, I got some new cologne, put on good clothes, cleaned my car, picked her up from her house, and took her to a sushi restaurant and then boba. The whole time I was trying to be very respectful, very gentlemanly. I came to her door, walked her to the car, walked her back to the door when I dropped her off. Didn't curse. Opened doors. Ordered for both of us (which she specifically asked me to do) Paid for everything without question. Eye contact. Asking questions. Everything you'd think that you should do. I thought the date went well, she agreed. We talked on the phone for a few hours the following day and texted for the next couple days. Then comes Thursday, I asked if she wanted to go out again that weekend. No response all day until she said goodnight. The next day I brought it up again, and she said she's actually going to a different state for a few days, I believed it, but I told my buddy and he said she's probably lying and about to ghost me. A handful of texts over the weekend, nothing of substance. This Monday, her friend who introduced us came over to my apartment and said ""My friend is being retarded. She don't want you any more."" I said that I can tell because she's barely text me. I asked why. She said that she said I was being weird and it seemed like I was trying too hard. Then she listed all of the things I was doing that I mentioned before. I said that that's not trying too hard, those are just proper gentlemanly things to do. She said that she knows that, but her friend apparently thought that me coming up to her door was weird, and ordering for both of us at the restaurant (which again she specifically asked me to do) made her feel like I was doubting her intelligence, and that the restaurant itself was ""too expensive for a first date."" (It wasn't) She then said ""Like I said, my friend is being retarded. She just wants another dumbass Mexican dude like her ex."" If that is true, then I suppose there was no winning in the first place. But still, WTF? What am I supposed to do, pull up and honk the horn then drive to Taco Bell and make her pay half?

Life as an only child with no friends or family members to actually form a connection with since you and your parents have nothing in common (dad was really into football which bored the hell out of me and sports and mom was into art but never pursued it even casually) is really lonely and lame, all I ever had to keep me company were toys and sometimes games but I wouldve given up every bit of that if it meant having some emotional connections or at least the ability to form them.

Amazing communication, same outlook on life, in agreement on how to raise kids someday, same interests, we absolutely love eachothers company, work through problems in a healthy way, you get the point. Something unique about him though is a surprisingly low sex drive compared to what other women tell me their men are like. I'm not particularly upset but I often wonder what it would be like to have a hyper sexual man. Basically I can't relate to videos online joking about how men never get sick of looking at boobs, mine did. He said when I am naked all the time every day he gets used to them and they aren't exciting anymore. Which I completely understand, but other women say their men wouldn't get bored of them in a million years. The next obviously big one is initiating sex. Don't get me wrong once we're doing it he's fine but 99% of the time we have sex it's because I initiated it and the times he did were all in the morning after waking up together. He is also very...how should I put it, nice? I have been asking him to hit me for 4 years now and he just won't. I ask him to be more aggressive but he just can't get himself to or doesn't understand. It's fine though I like being aggressive so I just take on that role but I'd like the experience it in reverse sometime. He has never smacked my ass once, never called me sexy (he calls me cute or pretty never hot or sexy), he's never looked at me like a piece of meat before. I have literally said to his face multiple times I want him to look at me like a piece of meat but he struggles to, it goes against his nature. I do find it funny though that every single meme or video online I see making fun of how men act in a relationship, I can relate to but it's me to him. I'm the one smacking his ass, tryna fuck, dirty talking to him randomly, calling him sexy all the time, always tryna feel him up or sneak a peak when he's naked, all the things men are stereotypically thought of to do. I also fart louder and smellier, am much louder, I'm a bit of a disorganized mess and he is clean and detail oriented and thoughtful, like it truly feels like we are the reverse couple sometimes. Please tell me i'm not alone? This isn't a complaint post as much of a sharing my story and wondering if I'm alone? I love him to death but it does feel like we are the only couple like this",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1gule2m/my_f24_husband_m25_has_a_very_low_sex_drive_and_i/,27

youngadults,2024-11-17 20:56:12,Odd communication behavior associated with mental illness,"Long read Interested in peoples thoughts on this. Because its something I definitely dont understand based on everything I grasp about healthy human behavior (41m). My adult son (20), experiences mental health problems and has for some time. Hes been to outpatient therapy, trials of many different medications, went inpatient for SI / emotional crisis, and hs gone through a month long substance abuse / mental health residential treatment program. Im quite certain genetic influence plays a huge role in his mental health, given that his mother (my ex wife), my mother, and his grandfather (maternal side) all seem to struggle with anxiety, depressed mood, and most importantly - personality disorder features (predominantly borderline PD). Not diagnosed per se, but due to my profession, I am virtually certain about BPD and other PD symptoms in my son. Weve always had a good relationship as father and son, until about a year ago. He started experimenting with drugs (although I dont think heavily by any means), mostly to deal with emotional problems and anxiety (self medication). He also started to say very mean things to me, which hed never done before. Things like You never help meyou never cared about meYou created this problem, now you have a mentally ill sonyou never got me helpyou never got me help when it matteredyoure terrible at your job (mental health)no one cares about meno one can help me. Hes also called me names over the phone and over text. When this happens, I end the conversation and shut things down. Hes never done that to my face however, most likely due to a significant strength and size difference between us. Hes never physically attacked me, as that would not go over well for him at all and he knows it. But he does engage in mental and emotional abuse toward others - then when confronted, he plays the victim. Anyway, he will tear into me relentlessly every once in a while, I ignore itand after a lot of time passes, he will randomly send me a song link...like Spotify, YouTube, etc. But no accountability for his actions whatsoever. Rarely hell send the word Sorry. Or hell say something like, Its ok if you want nothing to do with meno one else does so it doesnt matter or similar. When he sends a songIts as if thats his way of moving on and pretending things are fine now. Or if talking about his emotions. Meanwhile he has said he hates when his mother does that exact thing, meaning he hates when she behaves poorly and then pretends nothing happenedwhich is exactly what he does. I just dont entertain it anymore. No reinforcement, no reaction, no response. Is this a generational thing? Just completely ineffective and terrible communication ability? Or is that straight mental illness along with all the other aspects of mental illness he has? Why would he think randomly sending a song after being mean is somehow meaningful or important? Its nothing Ive ever modeled, taught, or encouraged in any way. Its funny how he used to be a lot like me and now hes almost unrecognizable. To me, some of the behavior seems immature, like a much younger teenager trying to get negative attention.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1gtnft7/odd_communication_behavior_associated_with_mental/,5

So when i become 14 or so, i decided to learn how to learn, after i heard about it from a voleetering organisation and that activated my curiosity about things, and then in the next 10 or so, ive gotten into pretty much any feild that come in my way. The lesson i learned is that there are a lot of simular concepts from feild to feild, and that using the scientific method and formal logic works really well to smooth out any inconsistencies, and so it becomes really easy to learn a thing since you imediatelly have a basis. Oh, and, trying to create something with the things you learned, is maybe the best way to solidify it in your mind.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1gtf3i9/hey_whats_your_experience_with_self_teaching_what/,2
youngadults,2024-11-17 01:06:35,Being kinda okay with doing nothing with my life atm.,"Tldr: I am 23 I live at home, I dont work, I dont pay anything. I am just doing nothing, and I am kinda okay with that. I feel like a spoiled brat, I possible am, but I am gonna be working 40+ years anyway, why rush it, when I can for the first time in my life do something for me. Which is nothing other than endulge in hobbies. Okay here goes. This might just be what a person of another generation would deem 'whats wrong with this generation' but I need to say something. Truth is I for the first time maybe ever am doing something for myself by yeah not doing anything. I am in the very very fortunate position where I, 23, half a year after I finished my degree is doing, nothing. I live at home still, I dont pay much to be here, my mom doesnt want me to, and I dont work. There are alot of factors behind the above, but what I just almost realized myself is that I am taking time for me. I get to do what I love doing, my hobbies every day, I get to have days where I just want to binge a whole season of a show in a day. I am 23 and I am in the very priveleged position where I have never had a job before and I know thats not a good thing, but thats a whole other topic. I feel alot of guilt and shame maybe even pressure from others and myself that stems from not working in my 20. But truth is I have the next 40-50 years of working ahead of me and I am in no rush to get to that point when I am in a position where I dont have to. Now after 3 months and technically I gave myself until january so less than 2 months left to not do anything, I think I am finally able to be okay with the fact that this is how it is. I probably shouldnt I am a spoiled brat in a lot of peoples eyes. But I am doing something for me. I have never done that before. I was miserable in school everyday from 7th grade, I went to HS because I had to, I was miserable everyday and questioning if I was at the right one but I pushed through. I started my teaching degree because it was something that peaked my interest and that is really scary to me but also really rewarding. I was miserable everyday for 4 years not because teaching isnt for me, I was just struggling with life, but I did it. So why shouldnt I get to take some time for myself for once. I know what path I am supposed to hit, so is it really that bad that I am taking the little longer way to get there? Now I am in no better position with everything than I was 3 months ago and I am not going to be in 2 months, a part of me feels like I am just waisting time but I am not. I am enjoying not feeling socially anxious everyday, of not feeling like I dont deserve to be a teaching student or a teacher, of not feeling good enough, worth anything, of not being physically ill everyday as I hit bedtime. I dont know why I am writing this, maybe someone relates maybe everyone will think I am spoiled and entitled and I am just another gen z who is complaining, but I think I am getting to a point where I am okay with this being me.. for now.

youngadults,2024-11-15 02:36:52,Has any of yall ever been completely ghosted/stopped being spoken to for absolutely no reason?,"This has been happening to me ever since August, but it never had any actual long lasting effects until early October. I used to hang out with some people from Uni (we're all first years but we're not all the same age), I had a blast with them as I could finally have a mature conversation with someone about the things we loved and life in general, people who had the same interests as me and someone that I could also play with as they re-awakened my will to play music. I talked to some of these people nearly every day from conversations to sending each other dumb reels on social media. Then one of us moved and it all went to shit, well for me at least. They all remained close, kept playing together and acting together (we were part of a theatre group too but most of us were just sort of a theatre band) and even went watching movies together while I was left behind for no apparent reason. I became lonely and if that wasn't enough I also fell ill from this (don't want to get into too much detail on this though), every time they get close to me now they just look at me weird and when someone forces me into the conversation they tend to be passive aggressive. I genuinely don't know what went wrong, it's gotten to the point where I've started to think that one of our classmates that knew me before university spilled the beans about what a dumb idiot I was in the past or about something that I did (keep in mind these 2 people knew me when I was 6 to 13 and haven't seen me since), but even I'm smart enough to realize that's just a dumb coping mechanism. This whole thing is so weird and it legit left me with no friends since I went NC with my old high school ""friends"" after meeting them, even though I would've done so anyways since they were jerks and were turning me into a jerk too.

youngadults,2024-11-14 18:10:21,is this unfair or am i being childish?,"hello, f19 here for context i am a NEET, though i am actively job hunting and i am applied to college. i have a very very hideous relationship with my mother. (see link for complete background) i will give a brief explanation. we clash over just about everything and she's been emotionally and mentally abusive for my entire life have had outsiders confirm this for me but there is one particular situation where i am really puzzled on if she is valid or not. i have a girlfriend and we're going a year and 2 months strong. we hardly ever fight about anything really, nothing that cannot be fixed with communication. she lives about a 45~ minute drive from my city, but attends college very close to me. the only thing that has gotten in the way in our relationship is my mother. early into our relationship, my mother would let me go out with my girlfriend, and at that point i was at her house and her at mine on a weekly basis. i only stayed the two day weekend. that has changed since my girlfriend attended college. since my girlfriend works part-time as well as goes to college, i can only see for on the days she doesn't have both those things to go to. granted i am over anyways while she's at work - but it's been so long in the relationship that her family and i are close and it's a non-issue. the problem started when my mother became more and more reluctant to let me visit her, at first she would ask why we hung out so frequently and as of a few months ago it's been ""why do you need to be over there so often?"" and it's only gotten worse where she wouldn't allow me to go out at all. and of course every time she tells me no, i will ask. in which her response is, ""because i said so."" which personally does not work for me. then at that point it becomes a screaming match where she tells me ""i don't live there, i live here. if i want to be over there so bad i might as well pack my bags and live there."" and all other ridiculous nonsense. i genuinely do not know why she throws all these things at me, as all i am doing is trying to visit my partner and her family who i love, in the timeframe that my partner's schedule allows her to. and i will say this now, yes i do live under her roof, her rules go. yes, she feeds me. yes to all of that. she sees that i am currently working on finding work and i rarely ask her for money to do things as i run my own freelance art business and i grind in order to do things with my partner. please read the link i shared in this post for more context. i just do not see how her controlling when i leave the house is fair, especially when all i can do sit around while i wait for call backs and the school year to begin. she gets on me for not being able to contribute but i cannot possibly do that when the money i do receive from my art is never consistent - nor has she ever asked for money so, i don't know... i am 19, at my prime time i won't be young forever and i cannot stop my life. i have already disobeyed her twice. once for halloween i had spent time and money building my costume for a big party in the city, only for her to tell me no the day before. i had gathered my things and left to my girlfriend's house for the weekend out. she called me and blew up my phone demanding i turn back around. at first she demanded i come home and stay home, but after she told me to collect my things and stay at my girlfriend's. i called up my family to let them know what had happened as i was seeking advice or also comfort. my aunt who answered my call was very supportive of me and said i should go out and my mom is crazy to get so angry with me. the second time was a week after that, granted i should've let it die down but honestly being at home is miserable. i didn't call my family that time as i found out she went to my family's house the day after our argument and lost her mind on them. it becomes a problem as my girlfriend has borderline personality disorder, and i am her favourite person, so if she's unable to see me, she oftentimes breaks down and it's hard for her to cope. i try really hard to keep her from hurting herself or acting impulsively, but it's hard when you really don't want to pick fights with family, especially in my position where i genuinely cannot afford to do so. i am uncomfortable moving in with my family as i am not working right now. i think when i get work i will have a lot more independence but i find it so unfair my mother tries to control my life still at my young adult age. i need serious advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NEET/s/Qa3OblRclE,4
youngadults,2024-11-14 06:59:21,Ranting about stuff idk what to call it exactly,"There's a few things I wanna write about, I'll try to keep it short but that's not going to happen. 1. There was a video of a skit where it shows a high school kid being happy, albeit very overworked, and managing school for 8+ hours a day and all these extra stuff after school and homework and friends and whatnot and then they get to college and they can't handle waking up at 9am and having to go to 3 one hour long classes. This is exactly how I feel, minus the happy part in high school. It feels like I'm slowly but surely falling apart, and it feels like 99% of people around me outclass me (I'm doing music minor and everyone else seems to be so much better, even high school kids and I'm in college). I know comparison is the their of joy and all but like, I just suck at it and it feels like no matter how much I practice I never get to the point where people will hear me play and go ""wow..."". This kind of relates to something else I want to talk about, which leads me to the next point. 2. It feels like no matter what I do, I'm not good enough at it. Obviously starting new things means you won't be good but I can't shake the feeling that I need to be better. I've tried writing, songwriting, animation, drawing, basically anything creative related I have tried and it hasn't worked out. I have all these ideas but none ever get done if I can even start them let alone finish them. I keep seeing this amazing sax player on YouTube, his name is Patrick Bartley and the dude is a legend, and I know I'm never going to be that good even though it would be cool. It just hurts knowing I'm going to be mediocre at whatever I do because no matter how much passion or motivation or whatever you want to call it I have, I'm just never good at things. 3. Why the hell is going to the doctor so expensive? And why is insurance so impossible to get? This is short, I just don't get it dude... I know I have issues, and I want to get them checked out, but I literally can't because a simple doctor visit is like $200 out of pocket.

Was my birthday yesterday, I didn't really do much, exams is a female dog. Treated myself with pizza and a great view, invited a friend that wasn't too far away. I shared some pizza with her, we talked at least like 2 hours. Sure, it's something you do when on a date, but we know it wasn't going to be like that. We even talked and joked about. Appreciate the good in life and it will grow, you'll enjoy life more. For those who say they don't have anything to be appreciative of. Go for a hike, alone if you have no other choice. Look at your situation, do you have a roof over your head? Do you have access to education? Do you have a job? And if you don't have friends, it's quite easy in my experience to change that. Go to a hobby shop where you can play games, just ask a group that's not busy playing to explain how the game they just played worked. And just ask if you can join them now or later. That is my next strategy to meet new people.

To be honest, I am having a hard time even just conceptualizing where a young adult could be happy and start their next chapter. Im leaving a relationship that broke me down emotionally for the last two years, and a place with a diverse community of people working towards a better place for all would be ideal to help me get my shit back together.

youngadults,2024-11-09 01:39:12,Parents can't understand trauma.,"Let's preface this by saying the one thing I regret most in the recent years is not moving away from my hometown after high school like I wanted to. I made a colossal mistake thinking that everything I had and everyone I had would last forever, which of course they didn't. I made a huge gamble and lost big time. Now all I've had for the past 5 months are my parents, my grandma, a few family members that show up every now and then, and my dog of 7 years. Exactly 5 months ago everything crumbled, he got attacked by a mastiff when he tried to sniff her privates because I was dumb enough to trust her imbecile of an owner and let him get closer, she bit him hard and split his shoulder open, all of this while I was just being dragged on the road fearing that if I pulled or intervened I would only make things worse. Let me tell you feeling powerless in do or die situations is something that crushes you up from the inside, as it has done and quite frankly still is doing for me. Ever since then I've been through countless traumas, even starting to suffer from chest and back pains so strong that I developed a fear of heart disease, even after multiple check ups saying I was one of the most physically healthy people they'd ever seen. My parents during all this have been accomodating, but in no way understanding or supportive. When I couldn't sleep during the night they thought that trying to talk me into calming down would work, and when they realized it didn't they switched it to yelling and making a fuss about how ""they"" feel. Same thing happened when I did sleep and woke up from pain or nightmares. Worst thing of all was a day after the attack, when I was still visibly shaken and my father told me that ""it was nothing and that I should stop complaining and move on"", and my mother backed him up on that. I quite frankly felt so devastated that I just snapped at them and we had a really bad fight, and ever since then it's never been the same for us. I've tried to explain to them multiple times that what they said felt like trying to put out a fire with gasoline, but they insist that ""they were just trying to cheer me up"", my mother gave me an unfelt apology while my dad didn't even bother, but I'm not surprised since he's never done that as he refuses to have made any sort of mistakes with me during the past. But tonight it hit a new low, when we were watching a comedy and a character had a heart attack, I couldn't bear it anymore and just walked out of the room. My mother came to find me and just said ""come on it's all fiction, it's not real"" as if that would magically get rid of my trigger, but all hell broke loose when I went back in, my dad asked me why I left and I told him I didn't wanna talk about it, only for him to push it and make me yell at him just to then act like a victim and storm out angrily, while my mother just scolded me for ""upsetting my father"", and later when I wanted to talk she just went to sleep in another room and left me. And just to clarify, I go to therapy for all these issues, and quite frankly I wish I didn't. I feel just as not listened to as I am at home, and during the latest session she talked to me and looked at me like some kind of mentally ill guy, but worst of all highly suggested psychiatric help to me as a first solution, when I specifically mentioned that I wanted it to be a last resort since I'm not that mentally unwell and I know I can pick myself back up with help and without anxiety meds. I do not know what to do anymore, I'm tired of staying with my parents but I've got nowhere to go, nowhere near enough to rent an apartment, no friends to talk to since my only real friend left for personal reasons (I don't want to doxx him) and no family as well since the only one who was slightly more understanding is dead.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1gmyzio/parents_cant_understand_trauma/,4

youngadults,2024-11-04 02:53:17,Ever since I hit the 20 mark I realize how downhill Ive been going,"A week-ish or so I turned 20, and tbh ever since I did I realized how much my life has gone downhill. I currently dont have anyone but my family (which isnt the greatest at times even though we still love each other/care for each other a lot), all my friends either left me or I cut them off because they I realized I was hanging out with jerks and a lot of it rubbed off on me, I never got a GF because I had eyes only for one girl, got toyed with once and ever since then Ive been on high alert with every girl whos tried to get close to me (to the point of rejecting 3 kiss attempts by a friend of mine), my only real friend left for personal reasons (I dont want to doxx him) and all the rest of our group did too emotionally, I pushed my old childhood best friend away because I was worried she would abandon me again and tell everyone what a jerk I was when we were little (and maybe because I didnt want to deal with the feelings I had for her), I realized I became a secondary friend. I feel like all this started when my dog got attacked 4 months ago, and even after he made a full recovery I still can feel the mental scar I got from that, but worst of all the physical scar it left on my physical health too. Nowadays I barely get out of bed, go to university, cook something, study but barely and stay awake late/pull an all-nighter. I even lost all my passion ofr what I do both for studies and hobbies. I started going to therapy for this but even there I dont feel like were working on making me better, I actually feel like Im getting worse. And to think that not even half a year ago my life was at its peak, I had a real friend I could count on, an amazing group of people with whom I could hang out with and have actual mature discussions AND I got to do what I love doing during all of this. I used to look forward to an amazing tomorrow, now I just cry myself to sleep praying that its gonna be decent/liveable. Im still struggling to accept the conseguences of losing my gamble and not moving away from home knowing this would hit me one day, and Ive been waiting for something to give me new purpose ever since, because Im tired of struggling every day, and while I know that I can never go back to how it was I at least know that I need to find the strength to better both me and my life up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1gj4iqf/ever_since_i_hit_the_20_mark_i_realize_how/,9

youngadults,2024-11-01 02:19:41,Rant about my life for past three years.,"Im a 21-year-old woman, and since I graduated high school in 2021, I honestly havent done much. For the past three years, Ive mostly just stayed in bed. I dont have any real-life friends anymore, and it feels like I missed out on so much of my life as a girl. I see my friend who went to a four-year college, having all sorts of fun, while Im just lying here, playing games and doom scrolling on TikTok. Growing up, I didnt have many friends because my mom was always really worried about my safety, and as a result, I had a pretty sheltered life. I only had one friend in high school, and even then, we didnt hang out much. I follow her on Instagram, but I barely post anything myself. I started feeling like this around my junior year, right before the pandemic. And these last three years have just made me feel even more down. I feel insecure, especially with the weight I gained during the pandemic. I tried taking classes online at a community college, but I got distracted easily and struggled to keep up with the work. Sometimes, it feels like I was born to be a failure because of how my mom raised me. Growing up overweight and feeling unattractive made it even harder to connect with others. I just feel like a mess and dont know how to handle things anymore I feel too dumb to go back to school. I actually feel lost in life rn.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1ggvcnx/rant_about_my_life_for_past_three_years/,7
youngadults,2024-11-01 00:12:46,I'm personally tired of settling with being a secondary friend.,"that's quite literally all I've been my whole life, the 2nd class friend, the one that you hang out with only during a certain hobby/at work/at school etc. And the thing that sucks the most is that I just realized it, or rather I just recently started accepting it. Literally for as long as I can remember existing no one ever wanted to hang out with me as they had ""other friends"" or their ""main friend group"" so I was always just the weird kid existing alone. My only real friend left me and moved away for personal reasons, and the friends we had in common just stopped talking to me altogether, I guess they were just interested in him and I was his third wheel (don't get me wrong I don't hate this guy but still, what he did hurt me), and I've been sick both physically and emotionally ever since. I honestly don't even know what to do, since nowadays your friend group is either your childhood friends or your high school mates (of which I have neither since I was ditched by my childhood friends and my high school classmates were all jerks). I don't want to be alone but I also refuse to be someone's backup for hanging out/talking etc. , I'd rather be alone than be someone's backup, because quite frankly that isn't true friendship and I've hurt myself enough that way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1ggsyvd/im_personally_tired_of_settling_with_being_a/,4

youngadults,2024-10-30 05:52:58,Should I Move Out?,"Hey! I am an undergraduate college student turning 21 in December. I currently live in Mississippi and have never identified well with the location I was born, as I politically and mentally don't fit in lol. I was adopted by my grandparents at a very young age and I am eternally grateful toward them for taking me in, but truthfully things have always felt off. They have made it clear I have a home with them as long as I need it for my entire life, but despite that I really want to move out. I graduated community college about five months ago and took a semester off to work and decide where I'm going to go to university. They supported this decision. Around three months ago it was brought to their attention that I'm interested in moving to San Antonio for college. (I'm studying law and they have a good area for it). My best friend is also attending college in San Antonio starting in January so I found this to be the perfect opportunity for me to move out and start finding my identity as a completely free adult. By no means has my family ever held me down or prevented me from going out or doing pretty much anything I felt I needed as a person, and they have truly been amazing. I can't stress enough that this wanting to move out is**NOT**because of anything they did. They want me to wait two more years until I get my bachelors degree and then move to San Antonio for law school. By then, my friend I proposed moving with will have already been there and completed his degree and potentially left San Antonio (that part is still up in the air). I, however, want to make the move in January with him, as I am attending college completely online and my area of residence will not affect my tuition whatsoever. (I'd end up paying maybe $1,000 out of pocket per semester after Financial Aid.) I'm pretty confident my friend and I can find a place we can afford, each paying roughly $450 a month for rent feels very doable (and seems like the average price for the apartments we are interested in in the area.) It goes without saying I would pay this myself and not rely on my family for aid, though they have been very vocal they would support me to the best of their ability wherever I decide to go. My only financial hang up is a bit of financial debt I have through a credit card, though I have the savings right now to pay it off completely if liquidated. I guess I'm just looking for some advice or maybe even just encouragement here lol TL;DR : I am 20 about to turn 21 and want to move out, my family is great and I can most likely afford it but they want me to wait until I get my degree.",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1gffqtz/should_i_move_out/,1

I didn't really start speaking to him until a few days after graduation during my friends birthday. We had a really good conversation and idk usually I take a while to build connections but I built a rlly good connection with him? I guess because he was close with one of my close friends idk lol.

I think my feelings developed for him more and more during this time. We would text mostly everyday, he used to message me good morning, we got into really deep conversations, just overall a lot more closer. I used to look forward to ending work and messaging him. He made me feel really happy and I def would say it turned out to be a crush lmao. (Also I think there was a few times he was flirting with me? Idk I might be wrong, maybe it was platonic, idek. We haven't actually confirmed anything romantic but I asked my friends and they all said he was flirting lol) OF COURSE I had to think with my brain.

I wanted to let high school go so I thought that liking him was a bad idea. I tried to get over it and eventually we got busy and didn't message each other for a bit, but I just couldn't stop thinking about him. I didn't know why, it felt so weird! I just started college last month and tbh I'm still kinda adjusting. It feels so weird lol and I've been very emotional about letting an old part of myself go. (even though that's what I wanted) And even though I started this new chapter, I still can't stop thinking about him. I recently messaged him again (in a friendly way, i wasn't trying to be romantic or anything) and we just had a full on convo. I still like him lol. I feel kind of a sadness though. He's still in high school. He's still in a building for 8 hours a day with a strict schedule while I have a bunch of class gaps (im a commuter as of now so it hits even more since I don't even live at my school) I can't stop thinking about him Any advice?",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1g9n3xn/im_a_college_freshman_and_i_like_a_high_school/,4
youngadults,2024-10-22 12:55:07,Do you think that people should take parenting classes before they become parents?,"Personally i find that parenting is taken as this thing which we somehow learn by witnessing our parents do it well or poorly, and no one really thinks about any other skill like this. Imagine if a pilots learned to fly aircrafts by just looking at how its done without learning any of the theory, and without having any practise before trying to fly passengers. Childhood, litterally the most foundational time for a human beeing, which dets up our entire lives, and its just left up to chance. Some part of me is like "" well, maybe it should be manditory"", and given how important it is, maybe it should. We have car licences, gun licences, but not childraising licences. And i do think that if its manditory then it should be free of charge, because its an investment that will improve any society in the long run, both socially as well as financially. Of course, the task is more complex then most in some ways, and as parents its good to know some practical degree of thease skills: 1. Formal logic 2. Emotional self regularion 3. Skepticism 4. The scientific method 5. Classical and operant conditioning 6.Nutrition Are there any you think i missed? What are your thoughts?

youngadults,2024-10-21 16:48:39,Is it weird to be friends with a 32 year old girl as a girl,"Im straight out of high school and I decided to go to a vocational school instead of college. I have an early birthday so even though this is my first year out of high school, I turn 19 in 2.5 months. Ive been at this vocational school for 5 weeks and every other week is virtual so I have only been on site for two weeks. There are 15 people in my class and the ages range from 18-43. Today is the first day of the third week on site and the last week that we were on site, a girl in the class realized that like non of us were friends so she made a group chat with all of us. On the group chat I texted on it apologizing for not talking to other people and I said how I was shy and wanted people to come up to me and that Im much more confident over text. Everyone else said that they were also more comfortable over text and that they would try to interact with each other more. This specific girl (we will call her Carly) said that she was extremely shy as well and I told her that I would talk to her next time we would be on site. So I came in today and we started talking and we started to become close. Carly and I were having a conversation and I told her smth that made her say wow Im old. So I asked her how old she is and she said 32. Shes really shy so it made me think she was younger than 25 but I guess not. She is the only person in my class that talks to me and I am the only person that talks to her. Is it weird that she is 13-14 years older than me, and would it be weird if we hung out outside of school?",https://www.reddit.com/r/youngadults/comments/1g8uf8u/is_it_weird_to_be_friends_with_a_32_year_old_girl/,14

I felt like I didnt know what I wanted to do in my life, working dead end job to dead end job, so I thought Id do something with my life and get myself into an electrician apprenticeship. I live with my gf and her parents so I do have an easy life, low rent etc however I have this burning feeling every second of the day that Im only choosing this career path because in the long run it could earn me loads of money and set me up for life. I know this is completely true and of course a smart decision to make, I just dont have any passion, desire or feelings of satisfaction to pursue this. I hate working on site, I dont like that whole environment after working on building sites since I left school. I felt Ive dug myself a hole after setting such high expectations for everyone to expect from me. Mainly my Mum. Growing up Ive had bad commitment issues from moving from house to house throughout my childhood and this has bled into my work life and not feeling satisfaction where I am and always looking for the next best thing and its something thats basically ruining my life. I really want to build a career and follow my passion for cars, creativity, music however Im so petrified on losing that expectation one last time after building up peoples expectations then losing them time and time and time again. I want to move away from the place I live, live the city life, build connections, be creative and everything in between. I need any advice on the best way to overcome my anxiety, desire to please people day in day out and life my life how I want to but ultimately making that leap of faith which is terrifying me.

I honestly feel so lost and conflicted. Like am I even still a young adult ? Like how I was 24 last year thinking about how I was gonna be turning 25 haha. I know its young but I also grew up in an ethnic household where once you turn 24/25, theres new pressures that arise from family that come out of no where. I just started realising how much my families thinking is so toxic and unhealthy. Its confusing for me because my parents have done allot for me but then they also have these expectations of they think is the right age to settle and have kids. I know at the end its my decision but it still sucks, especially when they these expectations come out of no where.And I hate how I just started realising toxic traits my parents have which I never really cared to notice before. On top of that my parents have always had a miserable marriage due to family pressures but are still so delusional on how their thinking doesnt make it any better. I cant even be honest about relationships or parts of my life because Ive noticed some things are just better kept quiet. The whole reason why I even lived it up in my teens was because I kept quiet but i hate having to lie as I get older. My mom also suffers from extreme separation anxiety from me which seems to be getting worse as I get older. My dad is the logical one but Ive realised, he also does lowkey enable the behaviour due to my moms reactions being extreme and also stressful to him. My fam also lacks knowledge on mental health and just choose to stop doing things to keep the peace even if it means it will hold you back. Im trying to get my mom help now but I feel so doubtful that would work. Ill probably make another post in detail but I think Im realising all this is the reason why Ive been having on and off age anxiety since turning 23. When Im with my friends or having fun , I barely thinking like that but as soon as Im with my family, I get this sudden anxiety that time is running out.

2025-07-10 19:23:19,did you ever use the app yubo?,"It was that app that was basically a Tinder-type thing, but for kids to make friends on. Only one of my friends ever had it, and I thought it was stupid. I made a troll account on there once, but I don't remember the login in so I guess somewhere on the app there is a photo of my friend edited to be shirtless and jacked. I also made a tinder troll account with this friends photos but I kept on getting middle aged men, I didnt understand how to work the settings lol.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lwlnad/did_you_ever_use_the_app_yubo/,0,MALICIOUS

I know guys who got 4 and 5 baby mamas none of the homies are married, not to sound ignorant but I always looked at marriage as a white people thing I don't know anybody in my race my age married, baby mamas and baby daddies was just normal.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lvjeyz/2125_is_a_weird_age/,805,MALICIOUS
2025-07-09 11:58:35,"I remember someone here posted asking when and how did non-Trump politicians ever operated against white men.

2025-07-09 03:17:34,The reason why immigrants are being frowned upon,"When you have people flooding into a country with no initiative to assimilate to the values and culture that country was built upon , the cultural climate of that country starts to change. White people arent the only ones worried about this but A lot of African Americans are coming to understand how this is impacting us as well. A lot immigrants come to place where ethnic enclaves are formed so they operate, live and work entirely inside their communities with no incentive to assimilate. Thats why you have Hispanics , Asians etc that have been here 20+ years and still dont know English. The biggest thing upsetting foundational American (those here before mass immigration) Whites (predominantly of English descent) black/African Americans (started being forced here as slaves in the 1600s) and natives (original people of this land). You go to some places like south Florida, Texas , California or New York and are being to made to feel like you dont belong in somewhere where you have historically always been. Many of the groups didnt not start having a actual presence until the 80s or 90s . These groups exhibit clannish behavior. For ex) once they are hired at a company they will hire nothing but Indians or Hispanic, they form communities that have entirely nothing but Asians or Hispanics. They will get in government and start putting policies in place that pushes you out of your community. For ex) Hispanics and California and south Florida requiring that employees speak Spanish. Wonder why the holidays arent the same as they were back in the day. Thats because country values shifts when it so many different ethnic groups here that do not share the same values. I could go on and on and on and on about how illegal immigration and multiculturalism has impacted American but if I did this post would be a whole book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lv8ffi/the_reason_why_immigrants_are_being_frowned_upon/,0,MALICIOUS
2025-07-08 21:21:43,Do you think people should date within their price range?,"Me personally, I think people should date within their price range. If you are a guy and you aren't financially successful, then you shouldn't date a financially successful woman. I think successful women deserve successful men, and unsuccessful men deserve unsuccessful women. Men need to pick their price range and just shut the fuck up. No, I'm not trolling; I think certain people deserve certain things. If a guy is ugly, he doesn't deserve a beautiful woman. Think about it like this: who are the only people mad at ""gold diggers""? It's only poor men who are mad because they are too broke to get a nice girlfriend/wife.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lv0que/do_you_think_people_should_date_within_their/,0,MALICIOUS
2025-07-07 17:41:19,People who whine about family and friends that Shame them for unhealthy eating habits have no idea how blessed they are,"They have someone in their life that cares enough to kick you in the ass and tell them the truth, even if it hurts their feelings. They have the tools in place to get back on track if they ever find a break and are able. They dont understand how its like to be on the other end. They dont understand how fucking debilitating it is hearing them shit talk you everytime they see you eating vegetables, healthier meats, being mindful of fat and sugar. Tracking calories. Its debilitating, not once has anyone in my family ever said they were happy I began exercising or began eating healthy. After years of shit talking me behind my back for eating French fries and burgers and chicken nuggets all the time. I still enjoy these things but Im more mindful of them, in fact I cook them by myself sometimes, as a cheaper and healthier alternative. They dont know how horrible and evil it is to catch yourself binge eating, and have everyone you know not only unconcerned, but *encouraging* you and giving you more sweets and cookies and cakes. Youre not in your right mind, its like taking advantage of a drunk woman. You know how fucked it is, cant even have a single meal in peace without my father or mother or brother walking in going Youre a grown ass man, stop thinking about what you eat like gee, thanks, I dont want to look like any of you. How depressing it is, to have not once heard Im so glad my son is eating healthy/exercising or Im so glad my son has found a way to do it despite his responsibilities its some bullshit or its them using *my* responsibilities as an excuse to tell me to fucking give up. Or when they can, using whatever means they have over me to make it impossible for me to reach my goals for the day. Incredibly fucking infuriating watching your formally athletic little brother *still* eat like an athlete, then wonder Why oh why is my black ass getting fat then try every trick in the book (Keto, low carb, trying to exercise his calories off, eating tiny amounts of junk food) instead of just tracking what he eats or eating healthier. But he cries and sobs when Im Too prideful to take his advice to just sit on my fucking ass and eat like a slob because Im smaller than him like no shot man youre six fooot two and have been training for basketball before your balls dropped. Im five foot eight and all I used to do was play Sonic the hedgehog. Of course youre bigger, in face, youre still getting bigger, not in a good way To hear your fatass +300lbs Buffon of a father talk you down because fiber is bad for you apparently, because it Catches food then spits it out, telling you bodybuilders like the rock eat 7000 calories a day to Recover from a measly 2 mile walk. And how I need to eat 5000 everyday if I were sitting on my fucking ass all day not working out. And I ought do 10k because I am. All of this while youre consistently gaining muscle/weight on a lean bulk of 2.7k-3k calories BECAUSE you walk 20k steps a day and lift 3 times a week. They dont believe it How fucking insane it is to have been overweight (175lbs, 20M, 5'8) and *still* considered tiny and skinny compared to the rest of them. Being told Im Sickly and Anorexic at 160, because I knew theyd lose their shit if I told them I was 150lbs. I went from 138 to 147 now after a slow lean bulk over 6 months (Albiet a couple of binging days) and they still dont see it. Im still the eternally anorexic girl-man to them. But Im feeling the effects of extra weight, weirdness and discomfort. In addition to some muscle gain. I dont understand how you can live being over 200lbs. how I ever lived at my previous weight You have no idea how blessed you are to have someone there to kick you in the ass when youre eating like shit. When youre inconsistent with exercise. It hurts your feelings, sure, but they love you. Thats why they tell you these things. Doesnt mean theyre *correct*, doesnt mean that *Their* way of being healthy is what you should do. But its proof they love you. Ive been sabotaged, limited, socially isolated and manipulated by my parents for so long and Im only now noticing it. My older sis has been trying to tell us for years but wed never listen. Id never listen. I can trust theyll want me to move out, but looking back at all the opportunities I missed because of fire bullshit they may provide for me, but they dont seem to want me to provide for myself. They shame me for it. But shame me everytime I take a step to get out of this hellhole. Maybe theyre doing all this for us because they feel guilty. Not out of love. That I even have to question if they Ive me or not, and it all started with my health journey.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lu0oih/people_who_whine_about_family_and_friends_that/,8,MALICIOUS

2025-07-04 11:47:14,Why can't Gen Z circuit train in the gym?,Why must you sit at a machine on your phone during recovery of 45 minutes. You can workout a different muscle group while the previous one is recovering. It actually makes working out faster and leads to less boredom. It also is considerate of people who need to use the machine you are using.

GenZ,2025-07-14 16:24:50,Just wanted to share!,"Hi! I am a 24F struggling with confidence and self-esteem. I have always been an introverted soul and always tried to do things from the back, never stepped forward, and never got a chance to do something that made everyone proud. But these days, I am trying to improve myself and build my confidence, but I feel like I am not getting it because I see people around me doing so well and being so confident when it comes to public speaking and networking. I was just wondering today I just want to feel that moment when it feels like being confident and people feel proud of you, that all eyes are on you, and people are watching you. I recently started showing interest in F1, and one thing I was curious about is: when these people win that race, what must they be feeling? What must they be thinking? How does it feel to win? I just really want to LIVE that moment when I win something, or I represent something, or give a presentation on a large scale. I know I am the only one who has to do the hard work and make this thing happen, but sometimes I question myself will I be able to do this one day or not?",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lzqyfk/just_wanted_to_share/,2

What's the point of fucking up if people are just going to get mad at you for doing so. Im saying this because I've had multiple experiences with friends and family where If I don't do something correct or perfectly the first time, I either got grounded, scolded, or just being a disappointment to others. So I grew up equating Mistakes = bad , bad = bad person. I feel like im a bad person for not being perfect. That's why being wrong pisses me off most of the time cause it means im a bad person again. This is why its damn near impossible for me to get into new hobbies, because all I can think about is the need to be PERFECT, because I know if im not perfect theres always gonna be someone who's disappointment in me or complain that I didn't do it right. It's also one of the reasons why I don't want friends or be in a relationship, cause all I can think about is perfectionism, and nobody wants to be in a relationship with someone who's constantly stressed about being Perfect.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lzojx1/nobody_is_perfect_until_you_dont_do_something/,2

GenZ,2025-07-14 11:18:53,Are GenZ defensive about the enshittification of cultural norms?,"Do you think that Gen Z get rather defensive about decline of cultural norms as they come of age? Millennials were openly nostalgic of better times when people dressed better, music was better, so on. Now Gen Z seems to have done a 180 where they defend objectively worse things while criticising past norms. I'm not talking about politics. I'm talking about almost innocuous things like sports, movies, music. For example, Gen Z idolise millennial actresses who objectively are worse actresses than those who were in the prime in the 90s and earlier. Emma Stone has obviously been a downgrade in terms of acting abilities and beauty from someone like Nicole Kidman. Yet some Gen Zs will try to claim that she's one of the best to ever do it. I don't think one Millennial would've said the same things about Scarlett Johansson or Natalie Portman. I don't think anyone tried to argue that Harry Potter was some cinematic masterpiece as opposed to entertainment. Well given the decline in the West's economic dominance, the twin decline in cultural standards is rather understandable, yet Gen Z don't seem to accept it?

Everyday when I open this app I've been seeing an increasing amount of heavily incel coded posts that have hundreds of thousands of likes, targeting random men and women as ""blackpill content"" and publicly humiliating them by calling them ugly among other things. Why are we as a generation allowing this sick ideology to spread? Why is TikTok allowing it especially? I'm sick of seeing incels force insecurities about their appearance and not getting into relationships because they're horrible, disgusting people. But they have somehow normalised blaming it on ""looksism"" and women. It's such a harmful way of thinking and it's actually poisoning this generation of men as social media platforms allow it to stay up and go viral. I know personally if I saw this stuff as a young teen I would have genuinely fallen into the incel rabbithole, thankfully, it was hardly as prevelant back then. Why can't we all just get along and stop blaming women for relationship issues and shaming ""unattractive people"" as being ""unsaveable"".

I am here on your defense: There is no such thing as a GenZ stare.,"When I saw the TikToks going viral on this issue I thought that this must be something particular to American young people, because I haven't seen this or experience this at all. I have met socially awkward people, especially on my job, but I didn't get the stare at all. Just normal every day awkwardness I would sometimes be guilty of doing myself. However, today, there was an incident at my village where a boy went missing. So I went outside to look for the kid. He was a toddler, autistic and non-verbal. So the mum was distressed and we were all worried. I got in touch with the mum on facebook, she told me where she lost him, decided to walk towards that direction and I happen to see a man with a little boy. Looked like the boy in the pics, he was crying, so I thought ""Oh he has been found and that man must be the father."" So decided to walk towards them, reached the dad while he put him down on the ground for a while, approached them and I was like ""Hi! Is this the little boy that went missing?"" And there it was. The stare. Took him like what felt a minute to reply ""Yes."" Then grabbed the kid and continued walking. No acknowledgement, nothing. It's so strange. And the thing is, it made me even more worried, because I only knew the mum and I had no idea who this man was and the fact he gave me no interaction rather than the buffer stare and a quick yes, I got nervous that someone might be kidnapping this kid, so I called the mum and told her that I saw the kid and asked if everything was ok. And she told me yes and thanked me for the help. So don't worry, it's not just you who are doing this.

(along with ADHD and ODD in elementary school) Which would later down the road not be a valid diagnosis once DSM-5 came out. And I ultimately wound up with f84.8 (ICD-10 code for: Other Pervasive Developmental Disorders) Most people would agree that autism isn't something you outgrow, But at the same time, you can't deny that there is a subtype of people seemingly associated with its PDD/ASD cohorts, who indeed did outgrow those baseline conditions, that were typically diagnosed with PDD-NOS in the first place. Hence, why in my opinion, they were never actually autistic to begin with. They instead were either misdiagnosed, or due to placeholders, overlapped with other conditions like ADD/ADHD, and simply had ""safety nets"" like PDD-NOS to help them in, say, a school setting.

My current situation: * I pretty much focused on studying and establishing my career after high school, attending several years of post-secondary education, all in effort to secure a relatively high-paying job with decent work-life balance. * Now, I live alone in an apartment I rent (of course keep in touch with my immediate family), have my own vehicle, and have over $250K CAD saved and invested. I pay all my bills on time, have no significant debt or student loans, etc. * I currently work in healthcare, making just over $100K CAD this year, working around 40 hours per week. Last year I made more, though at a stressful job in what was frankly a shithole place that I knew I had to get out of eventually, so I've moved to a more desirable city to prioritize better quality of life. * I work out at least 3-4 times a week, watch my diet and keep in good shape, since my health is definitely my top priority. I've gotten many unsolicited compliments from others in the past about my physique, from both men and women, not just ""gym bros"", LOL, so I can't be doing too bad. I don't think I'm bad-looking, have been in short-term relationships in the past, though I am currently single - still looking for ""the one"", LOL. Some things I didn't get to experience much of or feel like I am behind on, especially now that I'm in my late twenties: * I don't really have any close friends. I have plenty of acquaintances from school, work, gym, etc. Honestly, I prefer peace, quiet, and doing my own thing - I'm admittedly more introverted, though my job requires a lot of extroversion, having to speak to others all day. ""Friends"" mostly just serve to bring drama, jealousy, potential backstabbing which I certainly don't need or want - I don't think there's anything wrong with this at all, it's just something I've noticed. It seems like a lot of Gen Z folks are having fewer close friendships nowadays? * I don't have social media except for reddit and LinkedIn. Honestly, outside of my hobbies of making and saving money (which I can't really share to anyone in real life except my family), watching films/tv shows, working out and browsing the internet I'm quite a boring individual so I don't have much to post on social media anyways. * Related to the previous point, I don't have Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, that most of my generation (Gen Z) has.... * I honestly haven't travelled much at all. Am I missing out? **I guess my questions to everyone is:** 1. **At 27, am I still considered ""young"" overall?** 2. **Do you think I still have time to have ""fun""?

I cant be the minority that thinks thats absolutely ludicrous right? I feel so much empathy for people who are just entering the workforce around 18 years old knowing they have to slave away for 49 years minimum. Now I know people will start saying Tough luck, get a better job and save better so you can retire earlier. And I get that, but Im talking in a general sense, most people are living this kind of life. Work a job they hate for 49 years until they finally hit that pension. A 60+ year old working 80+ biweekly just doesnt sit right with me at all. In an ideal world I would say the age of 50 would be that fine balance between at least being able to enjoy the fruits of your hard earned labor instead of some years wasting away in a nursing home. I remember back when the age of retirement was 65 (still old as heck), but the fact that the government increased it by two years because the average human lifespan was increasing, and that makes me sick. People are living longer, and instead of us trying to enjoy those extra small years, the government saw that as a golden opportunity to milk more labor out of the common people.

GenZ,2025-07-11 22:19:06,Being short in 2025 is hell,"Its crazy how society only accepts confidence when it comes from someone who already fits the mold: tall, rich, attractive. When a tall guy or someone with status speaks his mind, hes called confident, assertive, admirable. But when a short man does the exact same thing when he sets boundaries, carries himself with pride, or refuses to shrink himself hes labeled arrogant or delusional. Its like people expect short men to know their place and stay quiet. The moment we show a shred of dignity or self-worth, were mocked for being insecure or trying too hard. Even worse, people gaslight us by pretending height doesnt matter, like were imagining the rejection, the disrespect, the way our presence is constantly downplayed. They say just be confident, while also punishing any sign of confidence that doesnt come from someone they already admire. Theres no winning. If you're quiet, you're weak. If you're proud, you're arrogant. If you complain, you're bitter. But staying silent doesnt make it easier, it just keeps the cycle going. Real confidence shouldn't be exclusive to those who already have power. Short men deserve to be respected when we carry ourselves with pride, not dismissed for daring to exist boldly. Edit: I also wanted to mention the most successful short people are people who are extravagantly successful in every other aspect of their life. By that I mean they usually have tons of money, looks,Fame,talent,intellgence just a general plethora of extremely positive things to lay back on which kind of just goes to show. You have to put in a lot of extra effort into everything else in your life if you want to be successful as a short person",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lxk4rc/being_short_in_2025_is_hell/,0

This results in some ethical debates as well you use these websites and give it information that you wouldnt tell your closes friends. On top of that it is impossible for there to be competition as if you had a choice between two companies that are free you would pick what is something that you have always used.

GenZ,2025-07-11 03:17:41,Hot Take: I actually liked the pandemic,"Everyday, I see people here and beyond talking about how detrimental the pandemic was to society, particularly Gen Z, but the truth is, I personally really liked the pandemic. Now obviously I did not like the deaths that COVID brought. Instead, I will be discussing the lockdown it brought. This is all my personal experience, although Im sure theres some that will relate. Essentially, my life wasnt that different from the one the pandemic brought upon the rest of the world. All my life, I had been bullied at school. I hated going outside, and while I did enjoy school, I would have preferred doing it online. When the lockdown came, it was heaven for me. The whole world got to see and experience the world through my lenses. It was nice knowing people knew what it was like to be home all day, to cut constant interaction with others. Not having to go outside. Staying home all day long, being safe. And I made more friends online than I would ever have made in person. The pandemic basically helped me, gave me some peace of mind. People always complain that the pandemic ruined their social lives, but COVID did the opposite to me. To this day, all my friends are online friends, simply because no one ever wanted to hang out with me physically. And Im okay with that, having unconventional friends is better than having none. Lastly, the pandemic was just a very fun time for me. Having so much time meant more time to explore new things, which for me included making YouTube videos. And while I dont do that anymore, I never would have even considered that had it not been for the spare time the pandemic brought. And quite frankly, if another pandemic happened, I would feel the same way. I know many people will disagree, but I do honestly think people only talk about how bad the pandemic was and forget about any good things that may have occurred during the time.

I don't feel so much societal pressure to have a kid as I expected to, which is a great thing for our generation, but I'm really confused about whether I want a baby for the right reasons. I've always been incredibly maternal, and couldn't wait to be pregnant/become a mother growing up. I have a natural affinity for children and have felt very at peace dealing with babies and young kids since I was barely a teen myself. For many years I've been convinced I wouldn't have them, mostly due to state of the climate, national economy, maternity packages in the countries I'd have an opportunity to raise them in, and personal/family history of both myself and my partners' mental health. I've suffered with depression in the past and have come along way but still feel this undeniable base level of sadness/unfulfillment. I've worked hard and gained a fair few qualifications, done lots of voluntary work, and have a great support system of family and friends, i.e. I've taken the obvious steps alongside having rewarding hobbies and years of therapy to feel ""whole"" and enjoy life, and this feeling had been part of reason I didn't want to have kids, but I'm wondering now whether it's exactly the reason I should. I'm quite confident that having a child would give me a purpose in life and help to light up my world, but this always seemed like a really selfish and arguably inappropriate reason to do it. However, I'm now wondering whether it's entirely natural that I would feel this way as our innate urge to procreate does still exist in most of us, and perhaps there's nothing wrong with requiring this element in life to feel fulfilled.

It made me think about how the game felt when I first started playing. Also a conversation about the MegaMan BattleNetwork series at work sparked up, which got me in the nostalgic mood. It's insane that a few of you weren't alive when I was playing the 1.4 beta in 2011. The game had a large following even before release. Redstone was fairly new, and I think piston's were just released. I remember staying up trying to figure out how to make double doors open with pressure plates at the *same* time. I don't enjoy that the caves now seem overly ubuiqitous, like a chore to venture, rather than a treat to find. I remember the old trick, where you had to press f11 (I think) and one of the graphs would spike in the direction of the cave. The content surrounding Minecraft was also semi-pleasant. [Like when Carl from The Walking Dead played Minecraft](https://youtu.be/WzZXbtr1dMs?si=hCMnrM47nnJn0Y1p). Back when you had to get frapps (or find a cracked version) before OBS became known or was available. I'm happy the community exists still, and new things are being added to it to this day. It even more pleases me that legacy versions ([like 1.4 beta](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_Beta_1.4)) are available for easy download. Anyways, just feeling nostalgic, wondering if anyone else has such a pleasant memory like mine. Frapps wasn't pleasant though. OBS is a f*cking God send.

Normally I would definitely just decide she doesn't want to hangout with me and move on however there are some factors that stop me. 1. I'm almost positive she's not lying about being tired, we work nightshift at a decently physically demanding job and she's works a fuck ton of overtime (the past 2 weeks she's worked 55+ hours each week) and I know how much nightshift can drain you even if you have normal hours.

Growing up I felt as if there were more niche things, people in their own circles whether they were punks, jocks, nerds or whatever. However all these groups actually had something in common which was that they found superficial and materialistic things quite lame. I remember girls and female celebrities being tired of reality tv stars, and there was growing concern about what social media would do (which... wow the old people finally got one right!). Sure some of that hate could be jealousy, but I don't think it was the foundation for criticizing desperate fame. But that desperate fame seems more charming to people now. Like if that's what they have to do to get that bag, go for it. Most art depicted the folly of greed as well. Apart from political condemnation of billionaires, praise of wealth and materialism seem higher than ever. And in fact criticism of that very much makes you the party pooper. It feels like the rich kids at school won, everyone wants to be Regina George not Cady. Most things are treated the way women use Halloween costumes, IT HAS TO BE SEXY. If something is goth it has to be sexy goth. Sexy nerd. Sexy poet. Sexy entrepreneur. Sexy painting. Sexy dancing. Sexy sex. I can't really think of who could be the Bill Hicks or George Carlin for gen z, the types who took a sledgehammer to the commercial culture of America. Maybe Bo Burnham, but he was quite ineffective and tame. I don't think we have to be mean to current icons but I do think we need some counterweight here. I also used to think Americans were uniquely superficial, until I got into kpop and learned a little more about the current culture for young people there lol. Mexico is changing closer to us too, to my surprise Japan also seems more superficial given that these types of conversations don't tend to happen at all there.

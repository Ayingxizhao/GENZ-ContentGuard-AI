GenZ,2025-07-14 16:24:50,Just wanted to share!,"Hi! I am a 24F struggling with confidence and self-esteem. I have always been an introverted soul and always tried to do things from the back, never stepped forward, and never got a chance to do something that made everyone proud. But these days, I am trying to improve myself and build my confidence, but I feel like I am not getting it because I see people around me doing so well and being so confident when it comes to public speaking and networking. I was just wondering today I just want to feel that moment when it feels like being confident and people feel proud of you, that all eyes are on you, and people are watching you. I recently started showing interest in F1, and one thing I was curious about is: when these people win that race, what must they be feeling? What must they be thinking? How does it feel to win? I just really want to LIVE that moment when I win something, or I represent something, or give a presentation on a large scale. I know I am the only one who has to do the hard work and make this thing happen, but sometimes I question myself will I be able to do this one day or not?",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lzqyfk/just_wanted_to_share/,2

Everyone knows that Nobody is perfect, but the shit the pisses me off about it is that, Nobody is perfect, until you dont do something perfectly then everyone Bitches, complains, moans and groans that you fucked up. What's the point of fucking up if people are just going to get mad at you for doing so. Im saying this because I've had multiple experiences with friends and family where If I don't do something correct or perfectly the first time, I either got grounded, scolded, or just being a disappointment to others. So I grew up equating Mistakes = bad , bad = bad person. I feel like im a bad person for not being perfect. That's why being wrong pisses me off most of the time cause it means im a bad person again. This is why its damn near impossible for me to get into new hobbies, because all I can think about is the need to be PERFECT, because I know if im not perfect theres always gonna be someone who's disappointment in me or complain that I didn't do it right. It's also one of the reasons why I don't want friends or be in a relationship, cause all I can think about is perfectionism, and nobody wants to be in a relationship with someone who's constantly stressed about being Perfect.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lzojx1/nobody_is_perfect_until_you_dont_do_something/,2

GenZ,2025-07-14 11:18:53,Are GenZ defensive about the enshittification of cultural norms?,"Do you think that Gen Z get rather defensive about decline of cultural norms as they come of age? Millennials were openly nostalgic of better times when people dressed better, music was better, so on. Now Gen Z seems to have done a 180 where they defend objectively worse things while criticising past norms. I'm not talking about politics. I'm talking about almost innocuous things like sports, movies, music. For example, Gen Z idolise millennial actresses who objectively are worse actresses than those who were in the prime in the 90s and earlier. Emma Stone has obviously been a downgrade in terms of acting abilities and beauty from someone like Nicole Kidman. Yet some Gen Zs will try to claim that she's one of the best to ever do it. I don't think one Millennial would've said the same things about Scarlett Johansson or Natalie Portman. I don't think anyone tried to argue that Harry Potter was some cinematic masterpiece as opposed to entertainment. Well given the decline in the West's economic dominance, the twin decline in cultural standards is rather understandable, yet Gen Z don't seem to accept it?

Everyday when I open this app I've been seeing an increasing amount of heavily incel coded posts that have hundreds of thousands of likes, targeting random men and women as ""blackpill content"" and publicly humiliating them by calling them ugly among other things. Why are we as a generation allowing this sick ideology to spread? Why is TikTok allowing it especially? I'm sick of seeing incels force insecurities about their appearance and not getting into relationships because they're horrible, disgusting people. But they have somehow normalised blaming it on ""looksism"" and women. It's such a harmful way of thinking and it's actually poisoning this generation of men as social media platforms allow it to stay up and go viral. I know personally if I saw this stuff as a young teen I would have genuinely fallen into the incel rabbithole, thankfully, it was hardly as prevelant back then. Why can't we all just get along and stop blaming women for relationship issues and shaming ""unattractive people"" as being ""unsaveable"".

I am here on your defense: There is no such thing as a GenZ stare.,"When I saw the TikToks going viral on this issue I thought that this must be something particular to American young people, because I haven't seen this or experience this at all. I have met socially awkward people, especially on my job, but I didn't get the stare at all. Just normal every day awkwardness I would sometimes be guilty of doing myself. However, today, there was an incident at my village where a boy went missing. So I went outside to look for the kid. He was a toddler, autistic and non-verbal. So the mum was distressed and we were all worried. I got in touch with the mum on facebook, she told me where she lost him, decided to walk towards that direction and I happen to see a man with a little boy. Looked like the boy in the pics, he was crying, so I thought ""Oh he has been found and that man must be the father."" So decided to walk towards them, reached the dad while he put him down on the ground for a while, approached them and I was like ""Hi! Is this the little boy that went missing?"" And there it was. The stare. Took him like what felt a minute to reply ""Yes."" Then grabbed the kid and continued walking. No acknowledgement, nothing. It's so strange. And the thing is, it made me even more worried, because I only knew the mum and I had no idea who this man was and the fact he gave me no interaction rather than the buffer stare and a quick yes, I got nervous that someone might be kidnapping this kid, so I called the mum and told her that I saw the kid and asked if everything was ok. And she told me yes and thanked me for the help. So don't worry, it's not just you who are doing this.

And I ultimately wound up with f84.8 (ICD-10 code for: Other Pervasive Developmental Disorders) Most people would agree that autism isn't something you outgrow, But at the same time, you can't deny that there is a subtype of people seemingly associated with its PDD/ASD cohorts, who indeed did outgrow those baseline conditions, that were typically diagnosed with PDD-NOS in the first place. Hence, why in my opinion, they were never actually autistic to begin with. They instead were either misdiagnosed, or due to placeholders, overlapped with other conditions like ADD/ADHD, and simply had ""safety nets"" like PDD-NOS to help them in, say, a school setting.

My current situation: * I pretty much focused on studying and establishing my career after high school, attending several years of post-secondary education, all in effort to secure a relatively high-paying job with decent work-life balance. * Now, I live alone in an apartment I rent (of course keep in touch with my immediate family), have my own vehicle, and have over $250K CAD saved and invested. I pay all my bills on time, have no significant debt or student loans, etc. * I currently work in healthcare, making just over $100K CAD this year, working around 40 hours per week. Last year I made more, though at a stressful job in what was frankly a shithole place that I knew I had to get out of eventually, so I've moved to a more desirable city to prioritize better quality of life. * I work out at least 3-4 times a week, watch my diet and keep in good shape, since my health is definitely my top priority. I've gotten many unsolicited compliments from others in the past about my physique, from both men and women, not just ""gym bros"", LOL, so I can't be doing too bad. I don't think I'm bad-looking, have been in short-term relationships in the past, though I am currently single - still looking for ""the one"", LOL. Some things I didn't get to experience much of or feel like I am behind on, especially now that I'm in my late twenties: * I don't really have any close friends. I have plenty of acquaintances from school, work, gym, etc. Honestly, I prefer peace, quiet, and doing my own thing - I'm admittedly more introverted, though my job requires a lot of extroversion, having to speak to others all day. ""Friends"" mostly just serve to bring drama, jealousy, potential backstabbing which I certainly don't need or want - I don't think there's anything wrong with this at all, it's just something I've noticed. It seems like a lot of Gen Z folks are having fewer close friendships nowadays? * I don't have social media except for reddit and LinkedIn. Honestly, outside of my hobbies of making and saving money (which I can't really share to anyone in real life except my family), watching films/tv shows, working out and browsing the internet I'm quite a boring individual so I don't have much to post on social media anyways. * Related to the previous point, I don't have Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, that most of my generation (Gen Z) has.... * I honestly haven't travelled much at all. Am I missing out? **I guess my questions to everyone is:** 1. **At 27, am I still considered ""young"" overall?** 2. **Do you think I still have time to have ""fun""?

I cant be the minority that thinks thats absolutely ludicrous right? I feel so much empathy for people who are just entering the workforce around 18 years old knowing they have to slave away for 49 years minimum. Now I know people will start saying Tough luck, get a better job and save better so you can retire earlier. And I get that, but Im talking in a general sense, most people are living this kind of life. Work a job they hate for 49 years until they finally hit that pension. A 60+ year old working 80+ biweekly just doesnt sit right with me at all. In an ideal world I would say the age of 50 would be that fine balance between at least being able to enjoy the fruits of your hard earned labor instead of some years wasting away in a nursing home. I remember back when the age of retirement was 65 (still old as heck), but the fact that the government increased it by two years because the average human lifespan was increasing, and that makes me sick. People are living longer, and instead of us trying to enjoy those extra small years, the government saw that as a golden opportunity to milk more labor out of the common people.

When a tall guy or someone with status speaks his mind, hes called confident, assertive, admirable. But when a short man does the exact same thing when he sets boundaries, carries himself with pride, or refuses to shrink himself hes labeled arrogant or delusional. Its like people expect short men to know their place and stay quiet. The moment we show a shred of dignity or self-worth, were mocked for being insecure or trying too hard. Even worse, people gaslight us by pretending height doesnt matter, like were imagining the rejection, the disrespect, the way our presence is constantly downplayed. They say just be confident, while also punishing any sign of confidence that doesnt come from someone they already admire. Theres no winning. If you're quiet, you're weak. If you're proud, you're arrogant. If you complain, you're bitter. But staying silent doesnt make it easier, it just keeps the cycle going. Real confidence shouldn't be exclusive to those who already have power. Short men deserve to be respected when we carry ourselves with pride, not dismissed for daring to exist boldly. Edit: I also wanted to mention the most successful short people are people who are extravagantly successful in every other aspect of their life. By that I mean they usually have tons of money, looks,Fame,talent,intellgence just a general plethora of extremely positive things to lay back on which kind of just goes to show.

Instead it gives you a free service but sells your information to companies which in turn make ads that is designed for you. This results in some ethical debates as well you use these websites and give it information that you wouldnt tell your closes friends. On top of that it is impossible for there to be competition as if you had a choice between two companies that are free you would pick what is something that you have always used. On the other hand having monthly payments would be annying in a pay by month service world. It could also price out those in poverty that cant afford the monthly subscriptions.,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lxcyip/would_yall_perfer_there_be_a_monthly_fee_to_use/,1

GenZ,2025-07-11 03:17:41,Hot Take: I actually liked the pandemic,"Everyday, I see people here and beyond talking about how detrimental the pandemic was to society, particularly Gen Z, but the truth is, I personally really liked the pandemic. Now obviously I did not like the deaths that COVID brought. Instead, I will be discussing the lockdown it brought. This is all my personal experience, although Im sure theres some that will relate. Essentially, my life wasnt that different from the one the pandemic brought upon the rest of the world. All my life, I had been bullied at school. I hated going outside, and while I did enjoy school, I would have preferred doing it online. When the lockdown came, it was heaven for me. The whole world got to see and experience the world through my lenses. It was nice knowing people knew what it was like to be home all day, to cut constant interaction with others. Not having to go outside. Staying home all day long, being safe. And I made more friends online than I would ever have made in person. The pandemic basically helped me, gave me some peace of mind. People always complain that the pandemic ruined their social lives, but COVID did the opposite to me. To this day, all my friends are online friends, simply because no one ever wanted to hang out with me physically. And Im okay with that, having unconventional friends is better than having none. Lastly, the pandemic was just a very fun time for me. Having so much time meant more time to explore new things, which for me included making YouTube videos. And while I dont do that anymore, I never would have even considered that had it not been for the spare time the pandemic brought. And quite frankly, if another pandemic happened, I would feel the same way. I know many people will disagree, but I do honestly think people only talk about how bad the pandemic was and forget about any good things that may have occurred during the time. Tl;dr: The pandemic was an introverts dream. No social interaction for a time was really refreshing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lwwdme/hot_take_i_actually_liked_the_pandemic/,77

I don't feel so much societal pressure to have a kid as I expected to, which is a great thing for our generation, but I'm really confused about whether I want a baby for the right reasons. I've always been incredibly maternal, and couldn't wait to be pregnant/become a mother growing up. I have a natural affinity for children and have felt very at peace dealing with babies and young kids since I was barely a teen myself. For many years I've been convinced I wouldn't have them, mostly due to state of the climate, national economy, maternity packages in the countries I'd have an opportunity to raise them in, and personal/family history of both myself and my partners' mental health. I've suffered with depression in the past and have come along way but still feel this undeniable base level of sadness/unfulfillment. I've worked hard and gained a fair few qualifications, done lots of voluntary work, and have a great support system of family and friends, i.e. I've taken the obvious steps alongside having rewarding hobbies and years of therapy to feel ""whole"" and enjoy life, and this feeling had been part of reason I didn't want to have kids, but I'm wondering now whether it's exactly the reason I should. I'm quite confident that having a child would give me a purpose in life and help to light up my world, but this always seemed like a really selfish and arguably inappropriate reason to do it. However, I'm now wondering whether it's entirely natural that I would feel this way as our innate urge to procreate does still exist in most of us, and perhaps there's nothing wrong with requiring this element in life to feel fulfilled.

Im a Zoomer guy who is trying to stay hopeful, but sometimes I genuinely wonder how others manage to stay motivated and think positively about the future and do things like starting a family (esp. having kids, taking mortgages, etc...) when we seem to be inheriting a world that feels increasingly hostile to us, especially to the ones who aren't rich or isolated. From overwhelming wealth inequality that makes it seem like working won't really get you anything anymore, and the mental health crisis to the cost of living disaster, climate change, wars essentially on every continent, automation threatening any chance for us to be able to climb the career ladder without being ""someone's child"", and less-talked-about issues like the healthcare worker shortage (aka that many of us wouldn't even be able to get an affordable, quality doctor to treat us), ecosystem collapse, rising crime and addiction rates, and even the looming threat of antibiotics-resistant bacteria its a lot.

On Monday we were planning on going to another Ice Cream place(I was actually planning on telling her how I fell that day) but at lunch she informed me she was feeling really tired and I told her I understood and I asked if we could reschedule to Wednesday, which she gave a ""If I'm feeling up to it then yes"" however today she just cancelled again over text, apologizing and asking if we can reschedule. Normally I would definitely just decide she doesn't want to hangout with me and move on however there are some factors that stop me. 1. I'm almost positive she's not lying about being tired, we work nightshift at a decently physically demanding job and she's works a fuck ton of overtime (the past 2 weeks she's worked 55+ hours each week) and I know how much nightshift can drain you even if you have normal hours. She mentioned how one day after getting home she slept almost 13 hours. 2. We have genuinely been having fun together I think, we're having good conversations and learning about each other. She also informed me (in a non-trauma dumpy way) of her traumatizing past and we talked about that and how she's recovered 3. She mentioned cancelling on another friend of hers because she was tired. Should I just give her space for a week or 2 then start trying to hang out again or does she probably just not sound interested?

Growing up I felt as if there were more niche things, people in their own circles whether they were punks, jocks, nerds or whatever. However all these groups actually had something in common which was that they found superficial and materialistic things quite lame. I remember girls and female celebrities being tired of reality tv stars, and there was growing concern about what social media would do (which... wow the old people finally got one right!). Sure some of that hate could be jealousy, but I don't think it was the foundation for criticizing desperate fame. But that desperate fame seems more charming to people now. Like if that's what they have to do to get that bag, go for it. Most art depicted the folly of greed as well. Apart from political condemnation of billionaires, praise of wealth and materialism seem higher than ever. And in fact criticism of that very much makes you the party pooper. It feels like the rich kids at school won, everyone wants to be Regina George not Cady. Most things are treated the way women use Halloween costumes, IT HAS TO BE SEXY. If something is goth it has to be sexy goth. Sexy nerd. Sexy poet. Sexy entrepreneur. Sexy painting. Sexy dancing. Sexy sex. I can't really think of who could be the Bill Hicks or George Carlin for gen z, the types who took a sledgehammer to the commercial culture of America. Maybe Bo Burnham, but he was quite ineffective and tame. I don't think we have to be mean to current icons but I do think we need some counterweight here. I also used to think Americans were uniquely superficial, until I got into kpop and learned a little more about the current culture for young people there lol. Mexico is changing closer to us too, to my surprise Japan also seems more superficial given that these types of conversations don't tend to happen at all there. I have maybe a too optimistic view of Nordic countries, but that gets me to wondering if any gen z people here have maybe a whole different perspective being from different countries.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lvio81/is_vanity_far_less_than_a_sin_now/,2

GenZ,2025-07-09 03:17:34,The reason why immigrants are being frowned upon,"When you have people flooding into a country with no initiative to assimilate to the values and culture that country was built upon , the cultural climate of that country starts to change. White people arent the only ones worried about this but A lot of African Americans are coming to understand how this is impacting us as well. A lot immigrants come to place where ethnic enclaves are formed so they operate, live and work entirely inside their communities with no incentive to assimilate. Thats why you have Hispanics , Asians etc that have been here 20+ years and still dont know English. The biggest thing upsetting foundational American (those here before mass immigration) Whites (predominantly of English descent) black/African Americans (started being forced here as slaves in the 1600s) and natives (original people of this land). You go to some places like south Florida, Texas , California or New York and are being to made to feel like you dont belong in somewhere where you have historically always been. Many of the groups didnt not start having a actual presence until the 80s or 90s . These groups exhibit clannish behavior. For ex) once they are hired at a company they will hire nothing but Indians or Hispanic, they form communities that have entirely nothing but Asians or Hispanics. They will get in government and start putting policies in place that pushes you out of your community. For ex) Hispanics and California and south Florida requiring that employees speak Spanish. Wonder why the holidays arent the same as they were back in the day. Thats because country values shifts when it so many different ethnic groups here that do not share the same values. I could go on and on and on and on about how illegal immigration and multiculturalism has impacted American but if I did this post would be a whole book.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lv8ffi/the_reason_why_immigrants_are_being_frowned_upon/,0

They have the tools in place to get back on track if they ever find a break and are able. They dont understand how its like to be on the other end. They dont understand how fucking debilitating it is hearing them shit talk you everytime they see you eating vegetables, healthier meats, being mindful of fat and sugar. Tracking calories. Its debilitating, not once has anyone in my family ever said they were happy I began exercising or began eating healthy. After years of shit talking me behind my back for eating French fries and burgers and chicken nuggets all the time. I still enjoy these things but Im more mindful of them, in fact I cook them by myself sometimes, as a cheaper and healthier alternative. They dont know how horrible and evil it is to catch yourself binge eating, and have everyone you know not only unconcerned, but *encouraging* you and giving you more sweets and cookies and cakes. Youre not in your right mind, its like taking advantage of a drunk woman. You know how fucked it is, cant even have a single meal in peace without my father or mother or brother walking in going Youre a grown ass man, stop thinking about what you eat like gee, thanks, I dont want to look like any of you. How depressing it is, to have not once heard Im so glad my son is eating healthy/exercising or Im so glad my son has found a way to do it despite his responsibilities its some bullshit or its them using *my* responsibilities as an excuse to tell me to fucking give up. Or when they can, using whatever means they have over me to make it impossible for me to reach my goals for the day. Incredibly fucking infuriating watching your formally athletic little brother *still* eat like an athlete, then wonder Why oh why is my black ass getting fat then try every trick in the book (Keto, low carb, trying to exercise his calories off, eating tiny amounts of junk food) instead of just tracking what he eats or eating healthier. But he cries and sobs when Im Too prideful to take his advice to just sit on my fucking ass and eat like a slob because Im smaller than him like no shot man youre six fooot two and have been training for basketball before your balls dropped. Im five foot eight and all I used to do was play Sonic the hedgehog. Of course youre bigger, in face, youre still getting bigger, not in a good way To hear your fatass +300lbs Buffon of a father talk you down because fiber is bad for you apparently, because it Catches food then spits it out, telling you bodybuilders like the rock eat 7000 calories a day to Recover from a measly 2 mile walk. And how I need to eat 5000 everyday if I were sitting on my fucking ass all day not working out. And I ought do 10k because I am. All of this while youre consistently gaining muscle/weight on a lean bulk of 2.7k-3k calories BECAUSE you walk 20k steps a day and lift 3 times a week. They dont believe it How fucking insane it is to have been overweight (175lbs, 20M, 5'8) and *still* considered tiny and skinny compared to the rest of them. Being told Im Sickly and Anorexic at 160, because I knew theyd lose their shit if I told them I was 150lbs. I went from 138 to 147 now after a slow lean bulk over 6 months (Albiet a couple of binging days) and they still dont see it. Im still the eternally anorexic girl-man to them. But Im feeling the effects of extra weight, weirdness and discomfort. In addition to some muscle gain. I dont understand how you can live being over 200lbs. how I ever lived at my previous weight You have no idea how blessed you are to have someone there to kick you in the ass when youre eating like shit. When youre inconsistent with exercise. It hurts your feelings, sure, but they love you. Thats why they tell you these things. Doesnt mean theyre *correct*, doesnt mean that *Their* way of being healthy is what you should do. But its proof they love you. Ive been sabotaged, limited, socially isolated and manipulated by my parents for so long and Im only now noticing it. My older sis has been trying to tell us for years but wed never listen. Id never listen. I can trust theyll want me to move out, but looking back at all the opportunities I missed because of fire bullshit they may provide for me, but they dont seem to want me to provide for myself. They shame me for it. But shame me everytime I take a step to get out of this hellhole. Maybe theyre doing all this for us because they feel guilty. Not out of love.

I got my education, went back for an MBA etc. I have a relatively low pay, entry level accounting job which for now lets me pursue my hobbies (BJJ,MMA, Lifting) so Im comfortable. More than comfortable actually. On paper, Id consider my life set up to be firmly above average. Im fit, food/shelter secure, eat out relatively often, have childhood friends I speak to semi regularly that still live close by, etc. Maybe I could travel more but thats not really my thing. The point is,Im not really that happy in all honesty. I feel kind of isolated a lot of the time, and I feel like at almost 24 years old, I shouldve developed more socially. My experiences with girls havent been that great, and they dont seem to like me too much. I was recently at a friends 4th of July party, and I think there was a girl that initially had some attraction to me, but my awkward demeanor and lack of social skills kind of killed it. Hinge and the dating apps dont seem to bear any fruit for me, and it just generally seems like I have no avenues through which to accomplish something I thought was a basic part of the human experience: a relationship. That plus the realization that my generation will likely not experience the quality of life our grandparents had due to the state of the world (ai/automation, global politics, etc) has just put me in a weird mood.

My style is basically what many English speakers call bland music, but honestly, that blandness is exactly what I love. For example, I have started liking Alex Warrens songs. I know a lot of people say his music is bland, but to me, that simplicity makes it so nice and calming. I just love simple songs with simple lyrics. I do not really like overdone songs with too much heavy mixing like rap, but I do listen to Coldplay sometimes, and I also watch videos of Freddie Mercury and Nirvana, though I only occasionally listen to their music. It is not that I hate them, they are legends, but when I just want to listen to music peacefully or feel emotional, those are not my first choices. I usually go with songs that are calm and straightforward, including songs in my mother tongue that suit this mood. But now I feel like I already know most of the common songs in this style, so I want to seek your opinions and find some underrated songs that are simple, melodic, and nice. I do not like songs with too much instrumental where the voice gets hidden. I love songs where the bare voice stands out with simple instrumentals. Also, as a side note, I really love songs that start slow and melodic and then go high and powerful in the chorus, like What Makes You Beautiful by One Direction, Carry You Home by Alex Warren, Best Song Ever by One Direction, Stitches by Shawn Mendes, and most Coldplay songs with that type of build up.

In last four years short video content became so common over time. For example on the busses, school breaks, houses and a lot of other environments. It's pretty simple to encounter with them. Lets talk about social media's damages: dopamine is one of the most important brain chemistry. It helps our to feel joyful because it triggers the happines. And people who producted short video content almost know this information more than too many psychologist. Thats why we struggle to give up from them. It makes same thing with a drug because they are both of them getting numb the brain.

GenZ,2025-07-06 12:53:57,How cooked are you if you get a useless degree in today's job market?,"I, being a naive 17 year old, decided that it would be a good idea to major in something that I enjoy and what I'm good at, rather than what actually makes money. So, I decided to major in English. I also believed the sentiment that a degree ""opens doors"", and ""tons of people work jobs unrelated to their degrees"", and that might've been true a few decades ago, but a BA is pretty much the new high school diploma. Also, most jobs I *do* come across don't just want ""a degree"". They want a specific degree (usually finance, business, etc), and multiple years of experience. To be honest, I will also admit, I don't really have any ""hard"" skills. Tons of soft skills sure, I'm good at reading, writing, etc, but these don't really translate to an actual career for the most part. Being able to analyze a Shakespeare sonnet is cool and all, but most employers couldn't give less of a shit. My fellow gen Zers who got ""useless"" degrees - were you able to make your degree work for you in any way and get gainful employment? Or will I have to go back to school for a ""useful"" degree if I ever want to make more than minimum wage?",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lt0is6/how_cooked_are_you_if_you_get_a_useless_degree_in/,13
GenZ,2025-07-06 11:48:14,Why do millennials always say this? Lmao,"I swear, it's either Gen Z has only ever had social media/phones/ipads/whatever in our life or they think we don't even know what a computer is. This happened irl to me once too lmfao. Had a milennial co worker once shocked I was fixing the older pc we had at work. Thought she was joking, but nope. Some of them really think we don't know anything.

GenZ,2025-07-06 05:42:03,Does anyone feel like youtube lost it's personality?,"Been thinking about this a lot, just watched a video about one of my favorite youtubers as a kid, and it just feels odd. You didn't really have to look hard on youtube back in the 2010s to find someone who was realistic, personable, funny, etc. Youtubers didn't have to be perfect, half the time it was just a dude in his bedroom playing video games with an absolutely terrible webcam, but he'd still get millions of views. Other times it'd be the most simple life vlogs that showed people's real lives, instead of walking around their beautiful condo with shiny white walls and not a speck of dust. It used to feel like we were getting an look into their real lives, actually connecting with them, whereas most youtubers these days (and like 2018 onward) feel almost manufactured. What happened to the personality? I feel like that's honestly part of the reason tiktok and other short form platforms have become more popular. Tiktokers replaced youtubers in the personality aspect... that kinda sucks though, youtube had a different vibe.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1lsts6t/does_anyone_feel_like_youtube_lost_its_personality/,31

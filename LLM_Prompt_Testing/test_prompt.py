- Promotes, normalizes, or spreads discriminatory ideas
- Makes negative generalizations about groups (race, income, gender, etc.)

- Dismisses or mocks social justice concerns
- Contains subtle prejudice or coded language

HARMFUL: "They're just protesting because they want attention"
HARMFUL: "Those people always complain"
OK: "I had a terrible day at work"
OK: "I disagree with this policy"
